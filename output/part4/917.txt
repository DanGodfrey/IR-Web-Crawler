Theropoda Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria  They first appeared during the Triassic period  approximately 230 million years ago  and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for 135 million years  from the beginning of the Jurassic  about 200 million years ago  until the end of the Cretaceous  65 5 million years ago   when the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups at the close of the Mesozoic era  The fossil record indicates that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic  and consequently they are considered a type of dinosaur in modern classification systems  1  2  Some birds survived the extinction event that occurred 65 million years ago  and continue the dinosaur lineage to the present day  Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic  morphological and ecological standpoints  Birds  at over 9 000 living species  are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish  3  Using fossil evidence  paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera 4  and more than 1 000 different species of non avian dinosaurs  5  Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species and fossil remains  6  Some are herbivorous  others carnivorous  Most dinosaurs have been bipedal  though many extinct groups included quadrupedal species  and some were able to shift between these body postures  Many species possess elaborate display structures such as horns or crests  and some prehistoric groups developed skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines  Birds have been the planet s dominant flying vertebrate since the extinction of the pterosaurs  and evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building is a trait shared by all dinosaurs  Many prehistoric dinosaurs were large animals the largest sauropods could reach lengths of almost 60 meters  200 feet  and were several stories tall and while many extinct theropods were quite large  a majority evolved very small sizes  especially among birds and other advanced groups  Although the word dinosaur means  terrible lizard   the name is somewhat misleading  as dinosaurs are not lizards  Rather  they represent a separate group of reptiles with a distinct upright posture not found in lizards  Through the first half of the 20th century  before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs  most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs were sluggish and cold blooded  Most research conducted since the 1970s  however  has indicated that ancient dinosaurs  particularly the carnivorous groups  were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction  Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century  mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons or replicas have been major attractions at museums around the world  and dinosaurs have become a part of world culture  Their diversity  the large sizes of some groups  and their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature have captured the interest and imagination of the general public for over a century  They have been featured in best selling books and films such as Jurassic Park  and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Definition 2 1 General description 2 2 Distinguishing anatomical features 3 Evolutionary history 3

of Saurian Reptiles  that were then being recognized in England and around the world  7  103 The term is derived from the Greek words         deinos  meaning  terrible    potent   or  fearfully great   and         sauros  meaning  lizard  or  reptile    7  103 8  Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs  teeth  claws  and other fearsome characteristics  Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty  9  Definition Triceratops horridus skeleton  American Museum of Natural History Under phylogenetic taxonomy  dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of  Triceratops  Neornithes  modern birds   their most recent common ancestor  and all descendants   10  It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the most recent common ancestor of Megalosaurus and Iguanodon  because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria  11  Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs   Dinosauria   Ornithischia   Saurischia   encompassing theropods  mostly bipedal carnivores and birds   ankylosaurians  armored herbivorous quadrupeds   stegosaurians  plated herbivorous quadrupeds   ceratopsians  herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills   ornithopods  bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including  duck bills    and  perhaps  sauropodomorphs  mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails   The common House Sparrow  Passer domesticus  is often used to represent modern birds in definitions of the group Dinosauria Many paleontologists note that the point at which sauropodomorphs and theropods diverged may omit sauropodomorphs from the definition for both saurischians and dinosaurs  To avoid instability  Dinosauria can be more conservatively defined with respect to four anchoring nodes  Triceratops horridus  Saltasaurus loricatus  and Passer domesticus  their most recent common ancestor  and all descendants  This  safer  definition can be expressed as  Dinosauria   Ornithischia   Sauropodomorpha   Theropoda   12  There is near universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs  In traditional taxonomy  birds were considered a separate  class  which had evolved from dinosaurs  However  a majority of modern paleontologists reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic nomenclature  which requires that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural  Birds are thus considered by most modern scientists to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are  therefore  not extinct  Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora  which are coelurosaurs  which are theropods  which are saurischians  which are dinosaurs  13  General description Using one of the above definitions  dinosaurs can be generally described as archosaurs with limbs held erect beneath the body  14  Many prehistoric animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs  such as ichthyosaurs  mosasaurs  plesiosaurs  pterosaurs  and Dimetrodon  but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs  and none had the erect limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs  15  Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic  especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods  Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches  mammals  for example  rarely exceeded the size of a cat  and were generally rodent sized carnivores of small prey  16  One notable exception is Repenomamus giganticus  a triconodont weighing between 12 kilograms  26 lb  and 14 kilograms  31 lb  that is known to have eaten small dinosaurs like young Psittacosaurus  17  Stegosaurus stenops skeleton  Field Museum Dinosaurs have always been an extremely varied group of animals  according to a 2006 study  over 500 non avialan dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far  and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1850  nearly 75  of which remain to be discovered  4  An earlier study predicted that about 3400 dinosaur genera existed  including many which would not have been preserved in the fossil record  18  By September 17  2008  1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named  5  Some are herbivorous  others carnivorous  While most dinosaurs have been bipeds  some prehistoric species were quadrupeds  and others  such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon  could walk just as easily on two or four legs  Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common among dinosaurs  and some extinct species had bony armor  Although known for large size  many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human sized or smaller  and modern birds are generally very small in size  Dinosaurs today inhabit every continents  and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period  6  Modern birds inhabit most available habitats  from terrestrial to marine  and there is evidence that some non avialan dinosaurs  such as Microraptor  could fly or at least glide  and others  such as spinosaurids  had semi aquatic habits  19  Distinguishing anatomical features While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed upon list of dinosaurs  distinguishing features  nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton  Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits  they are considered typical across Dinosauria  the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants  Such common features across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies  A detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by S  Nesbitt 20  confirmed or found the following 12 unambiguous synapomorphies  some previously known  in the skull  a supratemporal fossa  excavation  is present in front of the supratemporal fenestra epipophyses present in anterior neck vertebrae  except atlas and axis  apex of deltopectoral crest  a projection on which the deltopectoral muscles attach  located at or more than 30  down the length of the humerus  upper arm bone  radius shorter than 80  of humerus length fourth trochanter  projection where the caudofemoralis muscle attaches  on the femur  thigh bone  is a sharp flange fourth trochanter asymmetrical  with distal margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft on the astragalus and calcaneum the proximal articular facet for fibula occupies less than 30  of the transverse width of the element exocciptials  bones at the back of the skull  do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity proximal articular surfaces of the ischium with the ilium and the pubis separated by a large concave surface cnemial crest on the tibia  shinbone  arcs anterolaterally distinct proximodistally oriented ridge present on the posterior face of the distal end of the tibia Nesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies  and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested  Some of these are also present in silesaurids  which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria  including a large anterior trochanter  metatarsals II and IV of subequal length  reduced contact between ischium and pubis  the presence of a cenmial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus  10  and many others  Edmontonia was an armored dinosaur of the group Ankylosauria  Hip joints and hindlimb postures A variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs  However  because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs  these features are not considered to be synapomorphies  For example  as diapsids  dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae  openings in the skull behind the eyes   and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria  had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw  21  Additionally  several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs  or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups  These include an elongated scapula  or shoulder blade  a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae  three are found in some other archosaurs  but only two are found in Herrerasaurus   10  and an acetabulum  or hip socket  with a hole at the center of its inside surface  closed in Saturnalia  for example   22  Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways  these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature  23  Dinosaurs stand erect in a manner similar to most modern mammals  but distinct from most other reptiles  whose limbs sprawl out to either side  24  This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis  usually an open socket  and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur  25  Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving  which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of  sprawling  reptiles  26  Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs  27  Some non dinosaurian archosaurs  including rauisuchians  also had erect limbs but achieved this by a  pillar erect  configuration of the hip joint  where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip  the upper pelvic bone was rotated to form an overhanging shelf  27  Evolutionary history Main article  Evolution of dinosaurs Origins and early evolution Marasuchus  a dinosaur like ornithodiran Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late Triassic period  roughly 20 million years after the Permian Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95  of all life on Earth  28  29 Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time  Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs  30  if this is true  its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small  bipedal predators  31  The discovery of primitive  dinosaur like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view  analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small  bipedal predators  When dinosaurs appeared  terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of archosaurs and therapsids  such as aetosaurs  cynodonts  dicynodonts  ornithosuchids  rauisuchians  and rhynchosaurs  Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic  in one of two events  First  at about the boundary between the Carnian and Norian faunal stages  about 215 million years ago   dicynodonts and a variety of basal archosauromorphs  including the prolacertiforms and rhynchosaurs  became extinct  This was followed by the Triassic Jurassic extinction event  about 200 million years ago   that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs  like aetosaurs  ornithosuchids  phytosaurs  and rauisuchians  These losses left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs  dinosaurs  mammals  pterosaurians  and turtles  10  The first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through the Carnian and Norian stages of the Triassic  most likely by occupying the niches of the groups that became extinct  The early forms Herrerasaurus  large   Eoraptor  small  and a Plateosaurus skull Evolution and paleobiogeography Earth during the Jurassic  the period in which dinosaurs gained global distribution  The continents were in different locations from where they are today  Dinosaur evolution after the Triassic follows changes in vegetation and the location of continents  In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic  the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea  and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores  32 Gymnosperm plants  particularly conifers   a potential food source  radiated in the Late Triassic  Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth  and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract  33  The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic  where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians  spinosauroids  and carnosaurians  and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods  Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania  Dinosaurs in China show some differences  with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual  long necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus  32 Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common  but prosauropods had become extinct  Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants  Sauropods  like the earlier prosauropods  were not oral processors  but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth  including potential cheek like organs to keep food in the mouth  and jaw motions to grind food  33  Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds  descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians  13  By the Early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea  dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass  The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians  iguanodontians  and brachiosaurids through Europe  North America  and northern Africa  These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods  and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods  also found in South America  In Asia  maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids  troodontids  and oviraptorosaurians became the common theropods  and ankylosaurids and early ceratopsians like Psittacosaurus became important herbivores  Meanwhile  Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians  hypsilophodonts  and iguanodontians  32  The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early Late Cretaceous  A major change in the Early Cretaceous  which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous  was the evolution of flowering plants  At the same time  several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food  Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries  and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries  taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids  33  Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries  best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid Nigersaurus  34  There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous  In the northern continents of North America and Asia  the major theropods were tyrannosaurids and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods  with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids  ceratopsians  ankylosaurids  and pachycephalosaurians  In the southern continents that had made up the now splitting Gondwana  abelisaurids were the common theropods  and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores  Finally  in Europe  dromaeosaurids  rhabdodontid iguanodontians  nodosaurid ankylosaurians  and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent  32  Flowering plants were greatly radiating  33  with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous  35  Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia  Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores  with therizinosaurians and ornithomimosaurians becoming common  33  The Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event  which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period  caused the extinction of all dinosaur groups except for the neornithine birds  Some other diapsid groups  such as crocodilians  sebecosuchians  turtles  lizards  snakes  sphenodontians  and choristoderans  also survived the event  36  The surviving lineages of neornithine birds  including the ancestors of modern ratites  ducks and chickens  and a variety of waterbirds  diversified rapidly at the beginning of the Paleogene period  entering ecological niches left vacant by the extinction of Mesozoic dinosaur groups such as the arboreal enantiornithines  aquatic hesperornithines  and even the larger terrestrial theropods  in the form of Gastornis  mihirungs  and  terror birds    However  mammals were also rapidly diversifying during this time  and out competed the neornithines for dominance of most terrestrial niches  37  Classification Main article  Dinosaur classification Dinosaurs are archosaurs  like modern crocodilians  Within the archosaur group  dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait  Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body  whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either side  Collectively  dinosaurs as a clade are divided into two primary branches  Saurischia and Ornithischia  Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia  while Ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Triceratops than with Saurischia  Anatomically  these two groups can be distinguished most noticeably by their pelvic structure  Early saurischians   lizard hipped   from the Greek sauros          meaning  lizard  and ischion          meaning  hip joint   retained the hip structure of their ancestors  with a pubis bone directed cranially  or forward  25  This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups  Herrerasaurus  38 therizinosauroids  39 dromaeosaurids  40  and birds 13    Saurischia includes the theropods  exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of diets  and sauropodomorphs  long necked herbivores which include advanced  quadrupedal groups   By contrast  ornithischians   bird hipped   from the Greek ornitheios             meaning  of a bird  and ischion          meaning  hip joint   had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird s pelvis  the pubis bone was oriented caudally  rear pointing  Unlike birds  the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward pointing process  Ornithischia includes a variety of species which were primarily herbivores   NB  the terms  lizard hip  and  bird hip  are misnomers   birds evolved from dinosaurs with  lizard hips    Saurischian pelvis structure  left side  Tyrannosaurus pelvis  showing saurischian structure

of fossil and non fossil records  including fossilized bones  feces  trackways  gastroliths  feathers  impressions of skin  internal organs and soft tissues  42  43  Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs  including physics  especially biomechanics   chemistry  biology  and the earth sciences  of which paleontology is a sub discipline   Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior  Size Main article  Dinosaur size Scale diagram comparing the largest known dinosaurs in five major clades and a human Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic  early Jurassic  late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods  30  Theropod dinosaurs  when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on order of magnitude  most often fall into the 100 to 1000 kilogram  220 to 2200 lb  category  whereas recent predatory carnivorans peak in the 10 to 100 kilogram  22 to 220 lb  category  44  The mode of dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes  45  This contrasts sharply with the size of Cenozoic mammals  estimated by the National Museum of Natural History as about 2 to 5 kilograms  5 to 10 lb   46  The sauropods were the largest and heaviest dinosaurs  For much of the dinosaur era  the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat  and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth  Giant prehistoric mammals such as the Paraceratherium  the largest land mammal ever  were dwarfed by the giant sauropods  and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size  47  There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods  including protection from predation  reduction of energy use  and longevity  but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary  Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals  because food spends more time in their digestive systems  This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals  Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry  and the ability to eat large quantities of low nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments  48  Largest and smallest Scientists will probably never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs  This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize  and most of these remain buried in the earth  Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons  and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare  Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar  better known species is an inexact art  and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is  at best  a process of educated guesswork  Comparative size of Giraffatitan The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is Giraffatitan brancai  previously classified as a species of Brachiosaurus   Its remains were discovered in Tanzania between 1907 12  Bones from several similar sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the Museum f r Naturkunde Berlin  49  this mount is 12 meters  39 ft  tall and 22 5 meters  74 ft  long  and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between 30000 and 60000 kilograms  70000 and 130000 lb   The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 meter  89 ft  long Diplodocus  which was discovered in Wyoming in the United States and displayed in Pittsburgh s Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907  Comparative size of Eoraptor There were larger dinosaurs  but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils  Most of the largest herbivorous specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later  and include the massive Argentinosaurus  which may have weighed 80000 to 100000 kilograms  90 to 110 short tons   some of the longest were the 33 5 meters  110 ft  long Diplodocus hallorum 48   formerly Seismosaurus  and the 33 meters  108 ft  long Supersaurus  50  and the tallest  the 18 meters  59 ft  tall Sauroposeidon  which could have reached a sixth floor window  The heaviest and longest of them all may have been Amphicoelias fragillimus  known only from a now lost partial vertebral neural arch described in 1878  Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone  the animal may have been 58 meters  190 ft  long and weighed over 120000 kg  260000 lb   48  The largest known carnivorous dinosaur was Spinosaurus  reaching a length of 16 to 18 meters  50 to 60 ft   and weighing in at 8150 kg  18000 lb   51  Other large meat eaters included Giganotosaurus  Carcharodontosaurus and Tyrannosaurus  52  Not including modern birds  the smallest known dinosaurs known were about the size of a pigeon  53  Not surprisingly  the smallest dinosaurs were theropods closely related to birds  Anchiornis and Epidexipteryx both had a total skeletal length of under 35 centimeters  1 1 ft   53  54 Anchiornis is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen  with an estimated weight of 110 grams  54  The smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included Microceratus and Wannanosaurus  at about 60 cm  2 ft  long each  41  55  Social behavior A nesting ground of Maiasaura was discovered in 1978  Many modern birds are highly social  often found living in flocks  There is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in birds  as well as in crocodiles  bird  closest living relatives   were also common among extinct dinosaur groups  Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their habitat  computer simulations of their biomechanics  and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches  The first potential evidence for herding or flocking as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31 Iguanodon bernissartensis  ornithischians which were then thought to have perished together in Bernissart  Belgium  after they fell into a deep  flooded sinkhole and drowned  56  Other mass death sites have been subsequently discovered  Those  along with multiple trackways  suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species  Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck bills  hadrosaurids  may have moved in great herds  like the American Bison or the African Springbok  Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species  at least in Oxfordshire  England  57  although there is not evidence for specific herd structures  58  Congregated into herds may have evolved for defense  for migratory purposes  or to provide protection for young  There is evidence that many types of slow growing dinosaurs  including various theropods  sauropods  ankylosaurians  ornithopods  and ceratopsians  formed aggregations of immature individuals  One example is a site in Inner Mongolia that has yielded the remains of over 20 Sinornithomimus  from one to seven years old  This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud  59  The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey  60  61  However  this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds  crocodiles  and other reptiles  and the taphonomic evidence suggesting mammal like pack hunting in such theropods as Deinonychus and Allosaurus can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals  as is seen in many modern diapsid predators  62  Artist s rendering of two Centrosaurus  herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America The crests and frills of some dinosaurs  like the marginocephalians  theropods and lambeosaurines  may have been too fragile to be used for active defense  and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays  though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism  Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods  at least  engaged in active aggressive confrontations  63  From a behavioral standpoint  one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971  It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops  64  providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other  65  Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus  a hadrosaurid dinosaur  the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived  65 Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003  involving the theropod Majungasaurus  66  Comparisons between the scleral rings of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs  Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day  these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids  Juravenator  and Megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal  Large and medium sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians  sauropodomorphs  hadrosaurids  ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral  active during short intervals throughout the day  although the small ornithischian Agilisaurus was inferred to be diurnal  67  Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus  some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially fossorial  burrowing  lifestyle  68  and some bird like species may have been arboreal  tree climbing   most notably primitive dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor 69  and the enigmatic scansoriopterygids  70  However  most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land based locomotion  A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior  the science of biomechanics  in particular  has provided significant insight in this area  For example  studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs  skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run  71  whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip like tail snapping  72  and whether sauropods could float  73  Communication Artists impression of a striking and unusual visual display in an Lambeosaurus Modern birds are well known for communicating using primarily visual and auditory signals  and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups suggests that visual communication has always been important to dinosaur biology  However  the evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain  In 2008  paleontologist Phil Senter examined the evidence for vocalization in Mesozoic animal life  including dinosaurs  74  Senter found that  contrary to popular depictions of roaring dinosaurs in motion pictures  it is likely that most Mesozoic dinosaurs were not capable of creating any vocalizations  though the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines could have functioned as resonance chambers used for a wide range of vocalizations   75  76  To draw this conclusion  Senter studied the distribution of vocal organs in modern reptiles and birds  He found that vocal cords in the larynx probably evolved multiple times among reptiles  including crocodilians  which are able to produce guttural roars  Birds  on the other hand  lack a larynx  Instead  bird calls are produced by the syrinx  a vocal organ found only in birds  and which is not related to the larynx  meaning it evolved independently from the vocal organs in reptiles  The syrinx depends on the air sac system in birds to function  specifically  it requires the presence of a clavicular air sac near the wishbone or collar bone  This air sac leaves distinctive marks or opening on the bones  including a distinct opening in the upper arm bone  humerus   While extensive air sac systems are a unique characteristic of saurischian dinosaurs  the clavicular air sac necessary to vocalize does not appear in the fossil record until the enantiornithines  one exception  Aerosteon  probably evolved its clavicular air sac independently of birds for reasons other than vocalization   74  The most primitive dinosaurs with evidence of a vocalizing syrinx are the enantironithine birds  Any bird line archosaurs more primitive than this probably did not make vocal calls  Rather  several lines of evidence suggest that early dinosaurs used primarily visual communication  in the form of distinctive looking  and possibly brightly colored  horns  frills  crests  sails and feathers  This is similar to some modern reptile groups such as lizards  in which many forms are largely silent  though like dinosaurs they possess well developed senses of hearing  but use complex coloration and display behaviors to communicate  74  In addition  dinosaurs use other methods of producing sound for communication  Other animals  including other reptiles  use a wide variety of non vocal sound communication  including hissing  jaw grinding or clapping  use of environment  such as splashing   and wing beating  possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs   74  Reproductive biology All known dinosaurs reproduce by laying hard shelled eggs  When laying eggs  females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs  This medullary bone  which is rich in calcium  is used to make eggshells  A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and  for the first time  allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen  Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus  Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus very early in the evolution of dinosaurs  this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue  77  Fossilized egg of the oviraptorid Citipati  American Museum of Natural History Another widespread trait among modern birds is parental care for young after hatching  Jack Horner s 1978 discovery of a Maiasaura   good mother dinosaur   nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods  suggesting this behavior might have been common among Mesozoic dinosaurs  78  There is also evidence that other Cretaceous era dinosaurs  like Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods  1997 discovery   also nested in large groups  79  A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati was discovered in a chicken like brooding position in 1993  which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the eggs warm  80  Parental care is also implied by other finds  For example  the fossilized remains of a grouping of Psittacosaurus has been found  consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles  in this case  the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting  81  Additionally  a dinosaur embryo  pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus  was found without teeth  indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur  82  Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland  83  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs  and it appears likely that all dinosaurs cared for their young to some extent either before or shortly after hatching  Waste Like other reptiles  dinosaurs are primarily uricotelic  that is  their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine  In most living species  uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste  84  85  86  However  at least some modern birds  such as hummingbirds  can be facultatively ammonotelic  excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia  87  They also excrete creatine  rather than creatinine like mammals  This material  as well as the output of the intestines  emerges from the cloaca  88  89  In addition  many species regurgitate pellets  and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period  90  Physiology Main article  Physiology of dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus rex skull and upper vertebral column  Palais de la D couverte  Paris Because both modern crocodilians and birds have four chambered hearts  albeit modified in crocodilians   it is likely that this is a trait shared by all archosaurs  including all dinosaurs  91  While all modern birds have high metabolisms and are  warm blooded   endothermic   a vigorous debate has been ongoing since the 1960s regarding how far back in the dinosaur lineage this trait extends  Originally  scientists broadly disagreed as to whether non avian dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all  More recently  endothermy for all dinosaurs has become the consensus view  and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation  After non avian dinosaurs were discovered  paleontologists first posited that they were ectothermic creatures   terrible lizards  as their name suggests  This supposed cold bloodedness was used to imply that dinosaurs were relatively slow  sluggish organisms  even though many modern reptiles are fast and light footed despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature  The idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic and sluggish remained a prevalent view until Robert T   Bob  Bakker  an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy  published an influential paper on the topic in 1968  92  Modern evidence indicates that even non avian dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates  and that at least some early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means  aided by the animals  bulk in large species   Evidence of endothermy in Mesozoic dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica  where they would have experienced a cold  dark six month winter   and analysis of blood vessel structures within fossil bones that are typical of endotherms  Scientific debate continues regarding the specific ways in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved  93  Feathers and the origin of birds Main article  Origin of birds The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by Thomas Henry Huxley  94  After the work of Gerhard Heilmann in the early 20th century  the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of the idea of their being descendants of generalized thecodonts  with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of clavicles in dinosaurs  95  However  as later discoveries showed  clavicles  or a single fused wishbone  which derived from separate clavicles  were not actually absent  13  they had been found as early as 1924 in Oviraptor  but misidentified as an interclavicle  96  In the 1970s  John Ostrom revived the dinosaur bird theory  97  which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis  98  and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds  21  Of particular note have been the fossils of the Yixian Formation  where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found  often with feathers of some type  13  Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs  which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives  99  They are most closely allied with maniraptoran coelurosaurs  13  A minority of scientists  most notably Alan Feduccia and Larry Martin  have proposed other evolutionary paths  including revised versions of Heilmann s basal archosaur proposal  100  or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs  only convergent with dinosaurs  101  Feathers Main article  Feathered dinosaurs The famous Berlin Specimen of Archaeopteryx lithographica Archaeopteryx was the first fossil found which revealed a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds  It is considered a transitional fossil  in that it displays features of both groups  Brought to light just two years after Darwin s seminal The Origin of Species  its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism  This early bird is so dinosaur like that  without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock  at least one specimen was mistaken for Compsognathus  102  Since the 1990s  a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found  providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds  Most of these specimens were unearthed in the lagerst tte of the Yixian Formation  Liaoning  northeastern China  which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous  Though feathers have been found in only a few locations  it is possible that non avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered  The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record  To this point  protofeathers  thin  filament like structures  are known from dinosaurs at the base of Coelurosauria  such as compsognathids like Sinosauropteryx and tyrannosauroids  Dilong   103  but barbed feathers are known only among the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora  which includes oviraptorosaurs  troodontids  dromaeosaurids  and birds  13  104  The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy  perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham Soliar  who have proposed that protofeathers are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs  integument  105  106  107  and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with barbed feathers were not actually dinosaurs  but convergent with dinosaurs  101  106  However  their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers  to the point that the question of the scientific nature of Feduccia s proposals has been raised  108  Skeleton Because feathers are often associated with birds  feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs  However  the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists  Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck  pubis  wrist  semi lunate carpal   arm and pectoral girdle  furcula  wishbone   and breast bone  Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens the case for the link  Soft anatomy Pneumatopores on the left ilium of Aerosteon riocoloradensis Large meat eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds  according to an investigation which was led by Patrick O Connor of Ohio University  The lungs of theropod dinosaurs  carnivores that walked on two legs and had bird like feet  likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons  as is the case in birds   What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds   O Connor said  109  In a 2008 paper published in the online journal PLoS ONE  scientists described Aerosteon riocoloradensis  the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird like breathing system  CT scanning revealed the evidence of air sacs within the body cavity of the Aerosteon skeleton  110  111  Behavioral evidence Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides demonstrate that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms  112  This behavior  which may have helped to keep the head warm  is also characteristic of modern birds  Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved on top of their nests  likely brooding in a bird like manner  113  The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male  and that the young were highly precocial  similar to many modern ground dwelling birds  114  Some dinosaurs are known to have used gizzard stones like modern birds  These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibers once they enter the stomach  When found in association with fossils  gizzard stones are called gastroliths  115  Extinction of major groups Main articles  Cretaceous Tertiary extinction event and K Pg boundary The discovery that birds are a type of dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not  in fact  extinct as is commonly stated  116  However  all non avian dinosaurs as well as many groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 65 million years ago  Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time  including ammonites  nautilus like mollusks   mosasaurs  plesiosaurs  pterosaurs  and many groups of mammals  6  This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event  The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s  at present  several related theories are supported by paleontologists  Though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction  some scientists cite other possible causes  or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record  At the peak of the Mesozoic  there were no polar ice caps  and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250 meters  300 to 800 ft  higher than they are today  The planet s temperature was also much more uniform  with only 25  C  45  F  separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator  On average  atmospheric temperatures were also much higher  the poles  for example  were 50  C  90  F  warmer than today  117  118  The atmosphere s composition during the Mesozoic is a matter for debate  While some academics argue that oxygen levels were much higher than today  others argue that biological adaptations seen in birds and dinosaurs indicate that respiratory systems evolved beyond what would be necessary if oxygen levels were high  119  By the late Cretaceous  the environment was changing dramatically  Volcanic activity was decreasing  which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped  Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably  Some scientists hypothesize that climate change  combined with lower oxygen levels  might have led directly to the demise of many species  If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds  it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency  given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies  6  Impact event Main article  Chicxulub crater The Chicxulub Crater at the tip of the Yucat n Peninsula  the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur extinction  The asteroid collision theory  which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by Walter Alvarez and colleagues  links the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period to a bolide impact approximately 65 5 million years ago  Alvarez et al  proposed that a sudden increase in iridium levels  recorded around the world in the period s rock stratum  was direct evidence of the impact  120  The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a bolide 5 to 15 kilometers  3 to 9 mi  wide hit in the vicinity of the Yucat n Peninsula  in southeastern Mexico   creating the approximately 180 km  110 mi  Chicxulub Crater and triggering the mass extinction  121  122  Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event  Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth s atmospheric temperature  while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave  The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly  by heat from the meteorite impact  and also indirectly  via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun   Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone  various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid  being down to hours rather than years  123  In September 2007  U S  researchers led by William Bottke of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder  Colorado  and Czech scientists used computer simulations to identify the probable source of the Chicxulub impact  They calculated a 90  probability that a giant asteroid named Baptistina  approximately 160 km  99 mi  in diameter  orbiting in the asteroid belt which lies between Mars and Jupiter  was struck by a smaller unnamed asteroid about 55 km  35 mi  in diameter about 160 million years ago  The impact shattered Baptistina  creating a cluster which still exists today as the Baptistina family  Calculations indicate that some of the fragments were sent hurtling into earth crossing orbits  one of which was the 10 km  6 2 mi  wide meteorite which struck Mexico s Yucatan peninsula 65 million years ago  creating the Chicxulub crater  124  In 2011  new data from the Wide field Infrared Survey Explorer revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago  This makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the Chicxulub Crater  as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years  125  A similar but more controversial explanation proposes that  passages of the  hypothetical  solar companion star Nemesis through the Oort comet cloud would trigger comet showers   126  One or more of these comets then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time  causing the worldwide extinction  As with the impact of a single asteroid  the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures  followed by a protracted cool period  126  Deccan Traps Main article  Deccan Traps Before 2000  arguments that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual  as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 million years ago and lasted for over 2 million years  However  there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 65 5 million years ago  and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction  possibly over a period of thousands of years  but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event  127  128  The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms  including the release into the air of dust and sulphuric aerosols  which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants  In addition  Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions  which would have increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere  128  Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs  the release of volcanic gases during the formation of the Deccan Traps  contributed to an apparently massive global warming  Some data point to an average rise in temperature of 8  C  14  F  in the last half million years before the impact  at Chicxulub    127  128  In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction  Luis Alvarez  who died in 1988  replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data  While his assertion was not initially well received  later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim  Eventually  most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact  However  even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact  such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps  and these may have contributed to the extinctions  129  Failure to adapt to changing conditions Lloyd et al   2008  noted that  in the Mid Cretaceous  the flowering  angiosperm plants became a major part of terrestrial ecosystems  which had previously been dominated by gymnosperms such as conifers  Dinosaur coprolite fossilized dung indicate that  while some ate angiosperms  most herbivorous dinosaurs ate mainly gymnosperms  Statistical analysis by Lloyd et al  concluded that  contrary to earlier studies  dinosaurs did not diversify very much in the Late Cretaceous  Lloyd et al  suggested that dinosaurs  failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction  130  Possible Paleocene survivors Main article  Paleocene dinosaurs Non avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the K T boundary  In 2001  paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single hadrosaur leg bone fossil in the San Juan Basin  New Mexico  and described it as evidence of Paleocene dinosaurs  The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early Paleocene epoch  approximately 64 5 million years ago  If the bone was not re deposited into that stratum by weathering action  it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era  131  Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the Hell Creek Formation up to 1 3 meters  51 in  above  40000 years later than  the K T boundary  Similar reports have come from other parts of the world  including China  132  Many scientists  however  dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re worked  that is  washed out of their original locations and then re buried in much later sediments  133  134  However  direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date  with U Pb dating methods resulting in a precise age of 64 8   0 9 million years ago  135  If correct  the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction  133  History of study Further information  History of paleontology Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia  although their true nature was not recognized  The Chinese  whose modern word for dinosaur is konglong      or  terrible dragon    considered them to be dragon bones and documented them as such  For example  Hua Yang Guo Zhi  a book written by Zhang Qu during the Western Jin Dynasty  reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in Sichuan Province  136  Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized  dragon bones  for use in traditional medicines  a practice that continues today  137  In Europe  dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of giants and other creatures killed by the Great Flood  Marsh s 1896 illustration of the bones of Stegosaurus  a dinosaur he described and named in 1877  Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in England  Part of a bone  now known to have been the femur of a Megalosaurus  138  was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near Chipping Norton  Oxfordshire  England  in 1676  The fragment was sent to Robert Plot  Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum  who published a description in his Natural History of Oxfordshire in 1677  He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal  and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species  He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a giant human similar to those mentioned in the Bible  In 1699  Edward Lhuyd  a friend of Sir Isaac Newton  was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a sauropod tooth   Rutellum implicatum   139  140  that had been found in Caswell  near Witney  Oxfordshire  141  William Buckland Between 1815 and 1824  the Rev William Buckland  a professor of geology at Oxford University  collected more fossilized bones of Megalosaurus and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal  138  142  The second dinosaur genus to be identified  Iguanodon  was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell   the wife of English geologist Gideon Mantell  Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern iguanas  He published his findings in 1825  143  144  The study of these  great fossil lizards  soon became of great interest to European and American scientists  and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term  dinosaur   He recognized that the remains that had been found so far  Iguanodon  Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus  shared a number of distinctive features  and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group  With the backing of Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg Gotha  the husband of Queen Victoria  Owen established the Natural History Museum in South Kensington  London  to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits  In 1858  the first known American dinosaur was discovered  in marl pits in the small town of Haddonfield  New Jersey  although fossils had been found before  their nature had not been correctly discerned   The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii  It was an extremely important find  Hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found  the first was in 1834  in Maidstone  Kent  England   and it was clearly a bipedal creature  This was a revolutionary discovery as  until that point  most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet  like other lizards  Foulke s discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States  Othniel Charles Marsh  19th century photograph Edward Drinker Cope  19th century photograph Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh  both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the Bone Wars  The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope s reconstruction of an Elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed  Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur s head at what should have been the animal s tail end  The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years  ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt  Marsh  won  the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the US Geological Survey  Unfortunately  many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair s rough methods  for example  their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones  a method modern paleontologists would find appalling   Despite their unrefined methods  the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast  Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56  a total of 142 new species  Cope s collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York  while Marsh s is on display at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University  145  After 1897  the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent  including Antarctica  The first Antarctic dinosaur to be discovered  the ankylosaurid Antarctopelta oliveroi  was found on Ross Island in 1986  although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species  the theropod Cryolophosaurus ellioti  was formally named and described in a scientific journal  Current dinosaur  hot spots  include southern South America  especially Argentina  and China  China in particular has produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds  as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization  The  dinosaur renaissance  Main article  Dinosaur renaissance The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing  This was triggered  in part  by John Ostrom s discovery of Deinonychus  an active predator that may have been warm blooded  in marked contrast to the then prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold blooded  Vertebrate paleontology has become a global science  Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions  including India  South America  Madagascar  Antarctica  and most significantly China  the amazingly well preserved feathered dinosaurs in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants  modern birds   The widespread application of cladistics  which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms  has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs  Cladistic analysis  among other modern techniques  helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record  Soft tissue and DNA One of the best examples of soft tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in Petraroia  Italy  The discovery was reported in 1998  and described the specimen of a small  very young coelurosaur  Scipionyx samniticus  The fossil includes portions of the intestines  colon  liver  muscles  and windpipe of this immature dinosaur  42  In the March 2005 issue of Science  the paleontologist Mary Higby Schweitzer and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68 million year old Tyrannosaurus rex leg bone from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana  After recovery  the tissue was rehydrated by the science team  43  When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone marrow cavity  a process called demineralization   Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as blood vessels  bone matrix  and connective tissue  bone fibers   Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures  microstructures  even at the cellular level  The exact nature and composition of this material  and the implications of Schweitzer s discovery  are not yet clear  study and interpretation of the material is ongoing  43  The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions  but  upon further inspection and peer review  neither of these reports could be confirmed  146  However  a functional visual peptide of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds  147  In addition  several proteins  including hemoglobin  148  have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils  149  Cultural depictions Main article  Cultural depictions of dinosaurs By human standards  dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size  As such  they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture  Entry of the word  dinosaur  into the common vernacular reflects the animals  cultural importance  in English   dinosaur  is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large  obsolete  or bound for extinction  150  Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in Victorian England  where in 1854  three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains  the famous dinosaur sculptures were unveiled in London s Crystal Palace Park  The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed  In subsequent decades  dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and museums around the world  ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way  151  Dinosaurs  enduring popularity  in its turn  has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science  and has frequently spurred new discoveries  In the United States  for example  the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s  during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions  152  The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in literature  film and other media  Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in Charles Dickens  Bleak House  153  dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of fictional works  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle s 1912 book The Lost World  the iconic 1933 film King Kong  1954 s Godzilla and its many sequels  the best selling 1990 novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton and its 1993 film adaptation are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction  Authors of general interest non fiction works about dinosaurs  including some prominent paleontologists  have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general  Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in advertising  numerous companies have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements  either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow moving  dim witted or obsolete  154  See also
