Immigration to the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search 2000 Census Population Ancestry Map Immigration to the United States is a complex demographic phenomenon that has been a major source of population growth and cultural change throughout much of the history of the United States  The economic  social  and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity  economic benefits  jobs for non immigrants  settlement patterns  impact on upward social mobility  crime  and voting behavior  In 2006 the United States accepted more legal immigrants as permanent residents than all other countries in the world combined  1  After ethnic quotas on immigration were removed in 1965 2  the number of actual  first generation  immigrants living in the United States eventually quadrupled  3  from 9 6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in 2007  4  Over one million persons were naturalized as U S  citizens in 2008  The leading countries of origin of immigrants to the United States were Mexico  India  the Philippines  and China  5  Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the United States from 2000 to 2010  6  Family reunification accounts for approximately two thirds of legal immigration to the US every year  7  The number of foreign nationals who became legal permanent residents  LPRs  of the U S  in 2009 as a result of family reunification  66   exceeded those who became LPRs on the basis of employment skills  13   and for humanitarian reasons  17    8  Migration is difficult  expensive  and dangerous for those who enter the US illegally across the United States Mexico border  9  Participants in debates on immigration in the early twenty first century called for increasing enforcement of existing laws governing illegal immigration to the United States  building a barrier along some or all of the 2 000 mile  3 200 km  U S  Mexico border  or creating a new guest worker program  Through much of 2006 the country and Congress was immersed in a debate about these proposals  As of April 2010 update  few of these proposals had become law  though a partial border fence had been approved and subsequently canceled  10  Contents 1 History 2 Contemporary immigration 3 Demography 3 1 Origin 3 2 Immigration by state 4 Effects of immigration 4 1 Demographics 4 2 Economic 4 3 Social 4 3 1

Films about immigration 14 5 Economic impact History Main article  History of immigration to the United States American immigration history can be viewed in four epochs  the colonial period  the mid nineteenth century  the turn of the twentieth century  and post 1965  Each period brought distinct national groups  races and ethnicities to the United States  During the seventeenth century  approximately 175 000 Englishmen migrated to Colonial America  11  Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as indentured servants  12  The mid nineteenth century saw mainly an influx from northern Europe  the early twentieth century mainly from Southern and Eastern Europe  post 1965 mostly from Latin America and Asia  Immigrants arriving at Ellis Island  1902 Historians estimate that fewer than one million immigrants perhaps as few as 400 000 crossed the Atlantic during the 17th and 18th centuries  13  The 1790 Act limited naturalization to  free white persons   it was expanded to include blacks in the 1860s and Asians in the 1950s  14  In the early years of the United States  immigration was fewer than 8 000 people a year  15  including French refugees from the slave revolt in Haiti  After 1820  immigration gradually increased  From 1836 to 1914  over 30 million Europeans migrated to the United States  16  The death rate on these transatlantic voyages was high  during which one in seven travelers died  17  In 1875  the nation passed its first immigration law  18  The peak year of European immigration was in 1907  when 1 285 349 persons entered the country  19  By 1910  13 5 million immigrants were living in the United States  20  In 1921  the Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act  followed by the Immigration Act of 1924  The 1924 Act was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans  especially Jews  Italians  and Slavs  who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s  21  Most of the European refugees fleeing the Nazis and World War II were barred from coming to the United States  22  Polish immigrants working on the farm  1909  The welfare system was practically non existent before the 1930s and the economic pressures on the poor were giving rise to child labor  Immigration patterns of the 1930s were dominated by the Great Depression  which hit the U S  hard and lasted over ten years there  In the final prosperous year  1929  there were 279 678 immigrants recorded  23  but in 1933  only 23 068 came to the U S  13  In the early 1930s  more people emigrated from the United States than immigrated to it  24  The U S  government sponsored a Mexican Repatriation program which was intended to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico  but thousands were deported against their will  25  Altogether about 400 000 Mexicans were repatriated  26  In the post war era  the Justice Department launched Operation Wetback  under which 1 075 168 Mexicans were deported in 1954  27     First  our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually  Under the proposed bill  the present level of immigration remains substantially the same     Secondly  the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset     Contrary to the charges in some quarters   the bill  will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area  or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia     In the final analysis  the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think       Ted Kennedy  chief Senate sponsor of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965  28  The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965  also known as the Hart Cellar Act  abolished the system of national origin quotas  By equalizing immigration policies  the act resulted in new immigration from non European nations  which changed the ethnic make up of the United States  29  While European immigrants accounted for nearly 60  of the total foreign population in 1970  they accounted for only 15  in 2000  30  Immigration doubled between 1965 and 1970  and again between 1970 and 1990  31  In 1990  George H  W  Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990  32  which increased legal immigration to the United States by 40   33  Appointed by Bill Clinton  34  the U S  Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800 000 people per year to approximately 550 000  35  While an influx of new residents from different cultures presents some challenges   the United States has always been energized by its immigrant populations   said President Bill Clinton in 1998   America has constantly drawn strength and spirit from wave after wave of immigrants       They have proved to be the most restless  the most adventurous  the most innovative  the most industrious of people   36  An analysis of census data found that nearly eight million immigrants entered the United States from 2000 to 2005  more than in any other five year period in the nation s history  3 7 million of them entered illegally  37  38  Since 1986 Congress has passed seven amnesties for illegal immigrants  39  In 1986 president Ronald Reagan signed immigration reform that gave amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants in the country  40  Hispanic immigrants were among the first victims of the late 2000s recession  41  but since the recession s end in June 2009  immigrants posted a net gain of 656 000 jobs  42  1 1 million immigrants were

than the native population of the United States  with people between the ages of 15 and 34 substantially overrepresented  46  Immigrants are also more likely to be married and less likely to be divorced than native born Americans of the same age  47  Naturalization ceremony  Salem  Massachusetts  2007 Immigrants are likely to move to and live in areas populated by people with similar backgrounds  This phenomenon has held true throughout the history of immigration to the United States  48  Seven out of ten immigrants surveyed by Public Agenda in 2009 said they intended to make the U S  their permanent home  and 71  said if they could do it over again they would still come to the US  In the same study  76  of immigrants say the government has become stricter on enforcing immigration laws since the September 11  2001 attacks   9 11    and 24  report that they personally have experienced some or a great deal of discrimination  49  Public attitudes about immigration in the U S  were heavily influenced in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks  After the attacks  52  of Americans believed that immigration was a good thing overall for the U S   down from 62  the year before  according to a 2009 Gallup poll  50  A 2008 Public Agenda survey found that half of Americans said tighter controls on immigration would do  a great deal  to enhance U S  national security  51  Harvard political scientist and historian Samuel P  Huntington argued in Who Are We  The Challenges to America s National Identity that a potential future consequence of continuing massive immigration from Latin America  especially Mexico  might lead to the bifurcation of the United States  More than 80 cities in the United States  52  including Washington D C   New York City  Los

In the most recent decade  the ten million legal immigrants that settled in the U S  represent an annual growth of only about 0 3  as the U S  population grew from 249 million to 281 million  By comparison  the highest previous decade was the 1900s  when 8 8 million people arrived  increasing the total U S  population by one percent every year  Specifically   nearly 15  of Americans were foreign born in 1910  while in 1999  only about 10  were foreign born    55  By 1970  immigrants accounted for 4 7 percent of the US population and rising to 6 2 percent in 1980  with an estimated 12 5 percent to this date  56  As of 2010  a quarter of the residents of the United States under 18 are immigrants or are immigrants  children  57  Eight percent of all babies born in the U S  in 2008 belonged to illegal immigrant parents  according to a recent analysis of U S  Census Bureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center  58  Legal immigration to the U S  increased from 250 000 in the 1930s  to 2 5 million in the 1950s  to 4 5 million in the 1970s  and to 7 3 million in the 1980s  before resting at about 10 million in the 1990s  59  Since 2000  legal immigrants to the United States number approximately 1 000 000 per year  of whom about 600 000 are Change of Status who already are in the U S  Legal immigrants to the United States now are at their highest level ever  at just over 37 000 000 legal immigrants  Illegal immigration may be as high as 1 500 000 per year with a net of at least 700 000 illegal immigrants arriving every year  60  61  Immigration led to a 57 4  increase in foreign born population from 1990 to 2000  62  Crowd at the Philippine Independence Day Parade in New York City While immigration has increased drastically over the last century  the foreign born share of the population was still higher in 1900  about 20   than it is today  about 10    A number of factors may be attributed to the decrease in the representation of foreign born residents in the United States  Most significant has been the change in the composition of immigrants  prior to 1890  82  of immigrants came from North and Western Europe  From 1891 to 1920  that number dropped to 25   with a rise in immigrants from East  Central  and South Europe  summing up to 64   Animosity towards these different and foreign immigrants rose in the United States  resulting in much legislation to limit immigration  Contemporary immigrants settle predominantly in seven states  California  New York  Florida  Texas  Pennsylvania  New Jersey and Illinois  comprising about 44  of the U S  population as a whole  The combined total immigrant population of these seven states is 70  of the total foreign born population as of 2000  If current birth rate and immigration rates were to remain unchanged for another 70 to 80 years  the U S  population would double to nearly 600 million  63  The top twelve emigrant countries in 2006 were Mexico  173 753   People s Republic of China  87 345

Demographics The Census Bureau estimates the US population will grow from 281 million in 2000 to 397 million in 2050 with immigration  but only to 328 million with no immigration  70  A new report from the Pew Research Center projects that by 2050  non Hispanic whites will account for 47  of the population  down from the 2005 figure of 67   71  Non Hispanic whites made up 85  of the population in 1960  72  It also foresees the Hispanic population rising from 14  in 2005 to 29  by 2050  73  The Asian population is expected to more than triple by 2050  Overall  the population of the United States is due to rise from 296 million in 2005 to 438 million in 2050  with 82  of the increase from immigrants  74  In 35 of the country s 50 largest cities  non Hispanic whites were at the last census or are predicted to be in the minority  75  In California  non Hispanic whites slipped from 80  of the state s population in 1970 to 42 3  in 2008  76  77  Immigrant segregation declined in the first half of the century  but has been rising over the past few decades  This has caused questioning of the correctness of describing the United States as a melting pot  One explanation is that groups with lower socioeconomic status concentrate in more densely populated area that have access to public transit while groups with higher socioeconomic status move to suburban areas  Another is that some recent immigrant groups are more culturally and linguistically different than earlier group and prefer to live together due to factors such as communication costs  78  Another explanation for increased segregation is white flight  79  Place of birth for the foreign born population in the United States Top ten countries 2010 2000 1990 Mexico 11 711 103 9 177 487 4 298 014 China 2 166

late 1980s study  economists overwhelmingly viewed immigration  including illegal immigration  as a positive for the economy  80  According to James Smith  a senior economist at Santa Monica based RAND Corporation and lead author of the United States National Research Council s study  The New Americans  Economic  Demographic  and Fiscal Effects of Immigration   immigrants contribute as much as  10 billion to the U S  economy each year  81  The NRC report found that although immigrants  especially those from Latin America  caused a net loss in terms of taxes paid versus social services received  immigration can provide an overall gain to the domestic economy due to an increase in pay for higher skilled workers  lower prices for goods and services produced by immigrant labor  and more efficiency and lower wages for some owners of capital  The report also notes that although immigrant workers compete with domestic workers for low skilled jobs  some immigrants specialize in activities that otherwise would not exist in an area  and thus can be beneficial for all domestic residents  82  A non partisan report in 2007 from the Congressional Budget Office concluded that most estimates show that illegal immigrants impose a net cost to state and local governments  but  that no agreement exists as to the size of  or even the best way of measuring  the cost on a national level   83  Estimates of the net national cost that illegal immigrants impose on the United States vary greatly  with the Urban Institute saying it was  1 9 billion in 1992  and a Rice University professor putting it at  19 3 billion in 1993  84  About twenty one million immigrants  or about fifteen percent of the labor force  hold jobs in the United States  however  the number of unemployed is only seven million  meaning that immigrant workers are not taking jobs from domestic workers  but rather are doing jobs that would not have existed had the immigrant workers not been in the United States  85  U S  Census Bureau s Survey of Business Owners  Hispanic Owned Firms  2002 indicated that the number of Hispanic owned businesses in the United States grew to nearly 1 6 million in 2002  Those businesses generated about  222 billion in gross revenue  86  The report notes that the burden of poor immigrants is not born equally among states  and is most heavy in California  87  Another claim supporting expanding immigration levels is that immigrants mostly do jobs Americans do not want  A 2006 Pew Hispanic Center report added evidence to support this claim  when they found that increasing immigration levels have not hurt employment prospects for American workers  88  The number of garment factories in Manhattan s Chinatown has fallen from 400 in 2000 to about 150 in 2005  Most of the garment industry has moved to China  89  In 2009  a study by the Cato Institute  a free market think tank  found that legalization of low skilled illegal resident workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of  180 billion over ten years  90  The Cato Institute study chose to completely ignore the impact on per capita income for most Americans  Jason Riley notes that because of progressive income taxation  in which the top 1  of earners pay 37  of federal income taxes  even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income   60  of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in  which also reflects on immigrants  91  In any event  the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net  80 000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS  92  Legal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation  Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes  In 2010  an econometrics study by a Rutgers economist found that immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin  particularly boosting trade of final goods as opposed to intermediate goods  but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture  93  The Kauffman Foundation s index of entrepreneurial activity is nearly 40  higher for immigrants than for natives  94  Immigrants were involved in the founding of many prominent American high tech companies  such as Google  Yahoo  Sun Microsystems  and eBay  95  On the poor end of the spectrum  the  New Americans  report found that low wage immigration does not  on aggregate  lower the wages of most domestic workers  The report also addresses the question of if immigration affects black Americans differently from the population in general   While some have suspected that blacks suffer disproportionately from the inflow of low skilled immigrants  none of the available evidence suggests that they have been particularly hard hit on a national level  Some have lost their jobs  especially in places where immigrants are concentrated  But the majority of blacks live elsewhere  and their economic fortunes are tied to other factors   96  Interior view of a Lebanese restaurant in New Orleans  The analysis shows that 31  of adult immigrants have not completed high school  A third lack health insurance  37  Robert Samuelson points out that poor immigrants strain public services such as local schools and health care  He points out that  from 2000 to 2006  41 percent of the increase in people without health insurance occurred among Hispanics   97  According to the immigration reduction advocacy group Center for Immigration Studies  25 8  of Mexican immigrants live in poverty  which is more than double the rate for natives in 1999  98  In another report  The Heritage Foundation notes that from 1990 to 2006  the number of poor Hispanics increased by 3 2 million  from 6 million to 9 2 million  99  Hispanic immigrants in the United States were hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis  There was a disproportionate level of foreclosures in some immigrant neighborhoods  100  The banking industry provided home loans to undocumented immigrants  viewing it as an untapped resource for growing their own revenue stream  101  In October 2008  KFYI reported that according to the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  five million illegal immigrants held fraudulent home mortgages  102  The story was later pulled from their website and replaced with a correction  103  The Phoenix Business Journal cited a HUD spokesman saying that there was no basis to news reports that more than five million bad mortgages were held by illegal immigrants  and that the agency had no data showing the number of illegal immigrants holding foreclosed or bad mortgages  104  Since USCIS is 99  funded by immigration application fees many USCIS jobs have been created by immigration to US  such as immigration interview officials finger print processor  etc  An article by American Enterprise Institute researcher Jason Richwine states that while earlier European immigrants were often poor when they arrived  by the third generation they had economically assimilated to be indistinguishable from the general population  However  for the Hispanics immigrants the process stalls at the second generation and the third generation continues to be substantially poorer than whites  105  Despite apparent disparities between different communities  106  Asians  a significant number of whom arrived to the United States after 1965  107  had the highest median income per household among all race groups as of 2008  108  The passing of tough immigration laws in several states from around 2009 provides a view of actual outcomes  rather than theoretical predictions  The state of Georgia passed immigration law HB 87 in 2011 109   this led to 50  of its agricultural produce being left to rot in the fields  at a cost to the state of more than  400m  Overall losses caused by the act were  1bn  it was estimated that the figure would become over  20bn if all the estimated 325 000 undocumented workers left Georgia  The cost to Alabama of its crackdown in June 2011 has been estimated at almost  11bn  with up to 80 000 unauthorised immigrant workers leaving the state 110   Social Anti Italian lynching in New Orleans  1891  Benjamin Franklin opposed German immigration  stating that they would not assimilate into the culture  111  Irish immigration was opposed in the 1850s by the nativist Know Nothing movement  originating in New York in 1843  It was engendered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by Irish Catholic immigrants  In 1891  a lynch mob stormed a local jail and hanged several Italians following the acquittal of several Sicilian immigrants alleged to be involved in the murder of New Orleans police chief David Hennessy  The Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921  followed by the Immigration Act of 1924  The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at limiting immigration overall  and making sure that the nationalities of new arrivals matched the overall national profile  After the September 11 attacks  many Americans entertained doubts and suspicions about people apparently of Middle Eastern origins  citation needed NPR in 2010 fired a prominent black commentator  Juan Williams  when he talked publicly about his fears on seeing people dressed like Muslims on airplanes  112  Racist thinking among and between minority groups does occur  113  114  examples of this are conflicts between blacks and Korean immigrants  notably in the 1992 Los Angeles Riots  and between African Americans and non white Latino immigrants  115  116  There has been a long running racial tension between African American and Mexican prison gangs  as well as significant riots in California prisons where they have targeted each other  for ethnic reasons  117  118  There have been reports of racially motivated attacks against African Americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by people of Mexican origin  and vice versa  119  120  There has also been an increase in violence between non Hispanic Anglo Americans and Latino immigrants  and between African immigrants and African Americans  121  A 2007 study on assimilation found that Mexican immigrants are less fluent in English than both non Mexican Hispanic immigrants and other immigrants  While English fluency increases with time stayed in the United States  although further improvements after the first decade are limited  Mexicans never catch up with non Mexican Hispanic who never catch up with non Hispanics  The study also writes that  Even among immigrants who came to the United States before they were  ve years old and whose entire schooling was in the United States  those Mexican born have average education levels of 11 7 years  whereas those from other countries have average levels of education of 14 1 years   Unlike other immigrants  Mexicans have a tendency to live in communities with many other Mexicans which decreases incentives for assimilation  Correcting for this removes about half the fluency difference between Mexicans and other immigrants  122  Religious diversity Immigration from South Asia and elsewhere has contributed to enlarging the religious composition of the United States  Islam in the United States is growing mainly due to immigration  Hinduism in the United States  Buddhism in the United States  and Sikhism in the United States are other examples  123  Political See also

considered to be in a far stronger position among immigrants overall  124  125  Research shows that religious affiliation can also significantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of immigrants  as well as the broader American population  Hispanic evangelicals  for example  are more strongly conservative than non Hispanic evangelicals  126  This trend is often similar for Hispanics or others strongly identifying with the Catholic Church  a religion that strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage  Picture of a rally in Chicago  part of the Great American Boycott and 2006 U S  immigration reform protests  on May 1  2006  The key interests groups that lobby on immigration are religious  ethnic and business groups  together with some liberals and some conservative public policy organizations  Both the pro  and anti  groups affect policy  127  dead link  Studies have suggested that some special interest group lobby for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration  such as increased labor competition  as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when affecting other groups  citation needed  A 2007 paper found that both pro  and anti immigration special interest groups play a role in migration policy   Barriers to migration are lower in sectors in which business lobbies incur larger lobbying expenditures and higher in sectors where labor unions are more important   128  A 2011 study examining the voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that  that representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled  whereas the opposite is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts   129  After the 2010 election  Gary Segura of Latino Decisions stated that Hispanic voters influenced the outcome and  may have saved the Senate for Democrats   130  Several ethnic lobbies support immigration reforms that would allow illegal immigrants that have succeeded in entering to gain citizenship  They may also lobby for special arrangements for their own group  The Chairman for the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform has stated that  the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get    as will every other ethnic group in the country    131  132  The irrendentist and ethnic separatist movements for Reconquista and Aztl n see immigration from Mexico as strengthening their cause  133  134  The book Ethnic Lobbies and US Foreign Policy  2009  states that several ethnic special interest groups are involved in pro immigration lobbying  Ethnic lobbies also influence foreign policy  The authors write that  Increasingly  ethnic tensions surface in electoral races  with House  Senate  and gubernatorial contests serving as proxy battlegrounds for antagonistic ethnoracial groups and communities  In addition  ethnic politics affect party politics as well  as groups compete for relative political power within a party   However  the authors argue that currently ethnic interest groups  in general  do not have too much power in foreign policy and can balance other special interest groups  135  Health The issue of the health of immigrants and the associated cost to the public has been largely discussed  The non emergency use of emergency rooms ostensibly indicates an incapacity to pay  yet some studies allege disproportionately lower access to unpaid health care by immigrants  136  For this and other reasons  there have been various disputes about how much immigration is costing the United States public health system  137 University of Maryland economist and Cato Institute scholar Julian Lincoln Simon concluded in 1995 that while immigrants probably pay more into the health system than they take out  this is not the case for elderly immigrants and refugees  who are more dependent on public services for survival  138  Immigration from areas of high incidences of disease is thought to have fueled the resurgence of tuberculosis  TB   chagas  and hepatitis in areas of low incidence  139  According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   TB cases among foreign born individuals remain disproportionately high  at nearly nine times the rate of U S  born persons  140  141  To reduce the risk of diseases in low incidence areas  the main countermeasure has been the screening of immigrants on arrival  142 HIV AIDS entered the United States in around 1969  likely through a single infected immigrant from Haiti  143  144  Conversely  many new HIV infections in Mexico can be traced back to the United States  145  People infected with HIV were banned from entering the United States in 1987 by executive order  but the 1993 statute supporting the ban was lifted in 2009  The executive branch is expected to administratively remove HIV from the list of infectious diseases barring immigration  but immigrants generally would need to show that they would not be a burden on public welfare  146  Researchers have also found what is known as the  healthy immigrant effect   in which immigrants in general tend to be healthier than individuals born in the U S  147  148  Crime Empirical studies on links between immigration and crime are mixed  According to Bureau of Justice Statistics as of 2001  4  of Hispanic males in their twenties and thirties were in prison or jail  compared to 1 8  of non Hispanic white males  Hispanic men are almost four times as likely to go to prison at some point in their lives than non Hispanic white males  although less likely than non Hispanic African American males  149  Other writers have suggested that immigrants are under represented in criminal statistics clarification needed   In his 1999 book Crime and Immigrant Youth  sociologist Tony Waters argued that immigrants themselves are less likely to be arrested and incarcerated  he also argued  however  that the children of some immigrant groups are more likely to be arrested and incarcerated  This is a by product of the strains that emerge between immigrant parents living in poor  inner city neighborhoods  This occurs particularly in immigrant groups with many children as they begin to form particularly strong peer sub cultures  11  A 1999 paper by John Hagan and Alberto Palloni estimated that the involvement in crime by Hispanic immigrants is less than that of other citizens  150  A 2006 Op Ed in The New York Times by Harvard University Professor in Sociology Robert J  Sampson says that immigration of Hispanics may in fact be associated with decreased crime  151  A 2006 article by Migration Policy Institute cited data from the 2000 US Census as evidence for that foreign born men had lower incarceration rates than native born men  152  According to a 2007 report by the Immigration Policy Center  the American Immigration Law Foundation  citing data from the 2000 US Census  Native born American men between 18 39 are five times more likely to be incarcerated than immigrants in the same demographic  153  A 2008 study by the Public Policy Institute of California  found that      on average  between 2000 and 2005  cities that had a higher share of recent immigrants  those arriving between 2000 and 2005  saw their crime rates fall further than cities with a lower share  but adds   As with most studies  we do not have ideal data  This lack of data restricts the questions we will be able to answer  In particular  we cannot focus on the undocumented population explicitly   154  In a study released by the same Institute  immigrants were ten times less likely to be incarcerated than native born Americans  155  Locator map of countries and states with substantial presence of the criminal gang Mara Salvatrucha   darkness indicates strength  Explanations for the lower incarceration rates of immigrants include  Legal immigrants are screened for criminality prior to entry  Legal and illegal immigrants who commit serious crimes are being deported and therefore are unable to commit more crimes  unlike their US couterparts who remain in the US   They are unlikely to become  career criminals  moving in and out of the prison system  In the last 10 years  816 000 criminal aliens have been removed from the United States  This does not include immigrants whose only offense was living or working illegally in the United States  156  Immigrants understand the severe consequences of being arrested given their legal status  i e  threat of deportation   Heather MacDonald at the Manhattan Institute in a 2004 article argued that sanctuary policies has caused large problems with crime by illegal aliens since the police cannot report them for deportation before a felony or a series of misdemeanors takes place  In Los Angeles  95 percent of all outstanding warrants for homicide are for illegal aliens  Up to two thirds of all fugitive felony warrants  17 000  are for illegal aliens  60 percent of the 20 000 strong 18th Street Gang in southern California were illegal aliens in a 1995 report  157  The Center for Immigration Studies in a 2009 report argued that  New government data indicate that immigrants have high rates of criminality  while older academic research found low rates  The overall picture of immigrants and crime remains confused due to a lack of good data and contrary information   It also criticized the reports by the Public Policy Institute of California and Immigration Policy Center for using data from the 2000 Census according to which 4  of prisoners were immigrants  Non citizens often have a strong incentive to deny this in order to prevent deportation and there are also other problems  Better methods have found 20 22  immigrants  It also criticized studies looking at percentages of immigrants in a city and crime for only looking at overall crime and not immigrant crime  A 2009 analysis by the Department of Homeland Security found that crime rates were higher in metropolitan areas that received large numbers of legal immigrants  contradicting several older cross city comparisons  156  Environment Some commentators have suggested that increased immigration has a negative effect on the environment  especially as the level of economic development of the United States  and by extension  its energy  water 158  and other needs that underpin its prosperity  means that the impact of a larger population is greater than what would be experienced in other countries  159  Perceived heavy immigration  especially in the southwest  has led to some fears about population pressures on the water supply in some areas  California continues to grow by more than a half million a year and is expected to reach 48 million in 2030  160  According to the California Department of Water Resources  if more supplies are not found by 2020  residents will face a water shortfall nearly as great as the amount consumed today  161  Los Angeles is a coastal desert able to support at most one million people on its own water  162  California is considering using desalination to solve this problem  163  Education Forty percent of Ph D  scientists working in the United States were born abroad  94  A study on public schools in California found that white enrollment declined in response to increases in the number of Spanish speaking Limited English Proficient and Hispanic students  This white flight was greater for schools with relatively larger proportions of Spanish speaking Limited English Proficient  79  Effects on African Americans An econometic study bu George J  Borjas suggested that immigration had detrimental effects on African American employment in terms of lower wages and numbers employed  It reported that a 10  increase in the supply of workers reduced the black wage of that group by 2 5   lowered the employment rate by 5 9  and increased the Black incarceration rate by 1 3   164  Public opinion The ambivalent feeling of Americans toward immigrants is shown by a positive attitude toward groups that have been visible for a century or more  and much more negative attitude toward recent arrivals  For example a 1982 national poll by the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut showed respondents a card listing a number of groups and asked   Thinking both of what they have contributed to this country and have gotten from this country  for each one tell me whether you think  on balance  they ve been a good or a bad thing for this country   which produced the results shown in the table   By high margins  Americans are telling pollsters it was a very good thing that Poles  Italians  and Jews emigrated to America  Once again  it s the newcomers who are viewed with suspicion  This time  it s the Mexicans  the Filipinos  and the people from the Caribbean who make Americans nervous    165  166  In a 2002 study  which took place soon after the September 11 attacks  55  of Americans favored decreasing legal immigration  27  favored keeping it at the same level  and 15  favored increasing it  167  In 2006  the immigration reduction advocacy think tank the Center for Immigration Studies released a poll that found that 68  of Americans think U S  immigration levels are too high  and just 2  said they are too low  They also found that 70  said they are less likely to vote for candidates that favor increasing legal immigration  168  In 2004  55  of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41  said it should be decreased  169  The less contact a native born American has with immigrants  the more likely one would have a negative view of immigrants  169  One of the most important factors regarding public opinion about immigration is the level of unemployment  anti immigrant sentiment is where unemployment is highest  and vice versa  170  Surveys indicate that the U S  public consistently makes a sharp distinction between legal and illegal immigrants  and generally views those perceived as  playing by the rules  with more sympathy than immigrants that have entered the country illegally  171  Legal issues Laws concerning immigration and naturalization See also  Illegal immigration to the United States A USA B1 B2  tourist  visa  issued in Buenos Aires  Argentina  Laws concerning immigration and naturalization include  the 1990 Immigration Act  IMMACT   which limits the annual number of immigrants to 700 000  It emphasizes that family reunification is the main immigration criterion  in addition to employment related immigration  the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act  AEDPA  the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act  IIRIRA  AEDPA and IIRARA exemplify many categories of criminal activity for which immigrants  including green card holders  can be deported and have imposed mandatory detention for certain types of cases  Asylum for refugees Main article  Asylum in the United States A U S  green card  a document confirming permanent resident status for eligible immigrants  including refugees  political asylum seekers  family sponsored migrants  employment based workers and diversity immigrants  DV   In contrast to economic migrants  who generally do not gain legal admission  refugees  as defined by international law  can gain legal status through a process of seeking and receiving asylum  either by being designated a refugee while abroad  or by physically entering the United States and requesting asylum status thereafter  A specified number of legally defined refugees  who either apply for asylum overseas or after arriving in the U S   are admitted annually  quantify  Refugees compose about one tenth of the total annual immigration to the United States  though some large refugee populations are very prominent  citation needed  In the years 2005 through 2007  the number of asylum seekers accepted into the U S  was about 40 000 per year  This compared with about 30 000 per year in the UK and 25 000 in Canada  citation needed  Japan accepted just 41 refugees for resettlement in 2007  172  Since 1975  more than 1 3 million refugees from Asia have been resettled in the United States  173  Since 2000 the main refugee sending regions have been Somalia  Liberia  Sudan  and Ethiopia  174  The ceiling for refugee resettlement for fiscal year 2008 was 80 000 refugees  175  The United States expected to admit a minimum of 17 000 Iraqi refugees during fiscal year 2009  176  The U S  has resettled more then 42 000 Bhutanese refugees from Nepal since 2008  177  In 2009  President Bush set the admissions ceiling at 80 000 refugees  178  In FY 2008  the Office of Refugee Resettlement  ORR  was appropriated over  655 million for the longer term services provided to refugees after their arrival in the US  179  The Obama administration has kept to about the same level  180  Miscellaneous documented immigration In removal proceedings in front of an immigration judge  cancellation of removal is a form of relief that is available for certain long time residents of the United States  181  It allows a person being faced with the threat of removal to obtain permanent residence if that person has been physically present in the U S  for at least ten years  has had good moral character during that period  has not been convicted of certain crimes  and can show that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his or her U S  citizen or permanent resident spouse  children  or parent  This form of relief is only available when a person is served with a Notice to Appear to appear in the proceedings in the court  182  183  Members of Congress may submit private bills granting residency to specific named individuals  A special committee vets the requests  which require extensive documentation  The Central Intelligence Agency has

immigration debate  2006 U S  immigration reform protests  and H R  4437 The Illegal immigrant population of the United States is estimated to be between 7 and 20 million  184  The majority of the illegal immigrants are from Mexico  185  In a 2011 news story  Los Angeles Times reported   The annual report  relied upon by both sides in the contentious immigration debate  found 11 2 million illegal immigrants living in the U S   statistically identical to the 11 1 million estimated in 2009      The report also found that illegal immigrants in 2010 were parents of 5 5 million children  4 5 million of whom were born in the U S  and are citizens  Because illegal immigrants are younger and more likely to be married  they represented a disproportionate share of births   8  of the babies born in the U S  between March 2009 and March 2010 were to at least one illegal immigrant parent   186  Immigration in popular culture 1888 cartoon in Puck attacks businessmen for welcoming large numbers of low paid immigrants  leaving the American workingman unemployed  187  The history of immigration to the United States is the history of the country itself  and the journey from beyond the sea is an element found in American folklore  appearing over and over again in everything from The Godfather to Gangs of New York to  The Song of Myself  to Neil Diamond s  America  to the animated feature An American Tail  188  From the 1880s to the 1910s  vaudeville dominated the popular image of immigrants  with very popular caricature portrayals of ethnic groups  The specific features of these caricatures became widely accepted as accurate portrayals  189  In The Melting Pot  1908   playwright Israel Zangwill  1864 1926  explored issues that dominated Progressive Era debates about immigration policies  Zangwill s theme of the positive benefits of the American melting pot resonated widely in popular culture and literary and academic circles in the 20th century  his cultural symbolism   in which he situated immigration issues   likewise informed American cultural imagining of immigrants for decades  as exemplified by Hollywood films  190  191  The popular culture s image of ethnic celebrities often includes stereotypes about immigrant groups  For example  Frank Sinatra s public image as a superstar contained important elements of the American Dream while simultaneously incorporating stereotypes about Italian Americans that were based in nativist and Progressive responses to immigration  192  The process of assimilation was often a theme of popular culture  For example   lace curtain Irish  referred to middle class Irish Americans desiring assimilation into mainstream society in counterpoint to an older  more raffish  shanty Irish   The occasional malapropisms and left footed social blunders of these upward mobiles were gleefully lampooned in vaudeville  popular song  and the comic strips of the day such as  Bringing Up Father   starring Maggie and Jiggs  which ran in daily newspapers for 87 years  1913 to 2000   193  194  In recent years the popular culture has paid special attention to Mexican immigration 195  and the 2004 motion picture Spanglish tells of a friendship of a Mexican housemaid  Paz Vega  and her boss played by Adam Sandler  Immigration in literature Maggie and Jiggs from Bringing Up Father  January 7  1940   Novelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in their immigrant lives through their writings  196  Regarding Irish women in the 19th century  there were numerous novels and short stories by Harvey O Higgins  Peter McCorry  Bernard O Reilly and Sarah Orne Jewett that emphasize emancipation from Old World controls  new opportunities and expansiveness of the immigrant experience  197  On the other hand Hladnik studies three popular novels of the late 19th century that warned Slovenes not to immigrate to the dangerous new world of the United States  198  Jewish American writer Anzia Yezierska wrote her novel Bread Givers  1925  to explore such themes as Russian Jewish immigration in the early 20th century  the tension between Old and New World Yiddish culture  and women s experience of immigration  A well established author Yezierska focused on the Jewish struggle to escape the ghetto and enter middle  and upper class America  In the novel  the heroine  Sara Smolinsky  escape from New York City s  down town ghetto  by breaking tradition  She quits her job at the family store and soon becomes engaged to a rich real estate magnate  She graduates college and takes a high prestige job teaching public school  Finally Sara restores her broken links to family and religion  199  The Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg in the mid 20th century wrote a series of four novels describing one Swedish family s migration from Sm land to Minnesota in the late 19th century  a destiny shared by almost one million people  The author emphasizes the authenticity of the experiences as depicted  although he did change names   200  These novels have been translated into English  The Emigrants  1951  Unto a Good Land  1954  The Settlers  1961  The

Knapp  and Mark Harelik  The show is based on the story of Harelik s grandparents  Matleh and Haskell Harelik  who traveled to Galveston  Texas in 1909  203  Documentary films Film about historical immigration to America from ca  1970 In their documentary How Democracy Works Now  Twelve Stories  filmmakers Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini examine the American political system through the lens of immigration reform from 2001 2007  Since the debut of the first five films  the series has become an important resource for advocates  policy makers and educators  204  That film series premiered nearly a decade after the filmmakers  landmark documentary film Well Founded Fear which provided a behind the scenes look at the process for seeking asylum in the United States  That film still marks the only time that a film crew was privy to the private proceedings at the U S  Immigration and Naturalization Services  INS   where individual asylum officers ponder the often life or death fate of immigrants seeking asylum  Legal perspectives University of North Carolina law professor Hiroshi Motomura has identified three approaches the United States has taken to the legal status of immigrants in his book Americans in Waiting  The Lost Story of Immigration and Citizenship in the United States  The first  dominant in the 19th century  treated immigrants as in transition  in other words  as prospective citizens  As soon as people declared their intention to become citizens  they received multiple low cost benefits  including the eligibility for free homesteads in the Homestead Act of 1869  and in many states  the right to vote  The goal was to make the country more attractive  so large numbers of farmers and skilled craftsmen would settle new lands  By the 1880s  a second approach took over  treating newcomers as  immigrants by contract   An implicit deal existed where immigrants who were literate and could earn their own living were permitted in restricted numbers  Once in the United States  they would have limited legal rights  but were not allowed to vote until they became citizens  and would not be eligible for the New Deal government benefits available in the 1930s  The third and more recent policy when   is  immigration by affiliation   which Motomura argues is the treatment which depends on how deeply rooted people have become in the country  An immigrant who applies for citizenship as soon as permitted  has a long history of working in the United States  and has significant family ties  is more deeply affiliated and can expect better treatment  205  It has been suggested that the US should adopt policies similar to those in Canada and Australia and select for desired qualities such as education and work experience  Another suggestion is to reduce legal immigration because of being a relative  except for nuclear family members  since such immigrations of extended relatives  who in turn bring in their own extended relatives  may cause a perpetual cycle of  chain immigration   105  Interpretive perspectives The Statue of Liberty was a common sight to many immigrants who entered the United States through Ellis Island The American Dream is the belief that through hard work and determination  any United States immigrant can achieve a better life  usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice  206  According to historians  the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U S  is not simply a function of being a resource rich  hard working  and inventive country  but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country s wealth if he or she was willing to work hard  207  This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States  208  See
