of disputed claims to several islands in the Persian Gulf  the lack of precise information on the size of many of these islands and that most of its land boundaries  especially with Saudi Arabia  remain un demarcated  This article contains Arabic text  written from right to left in a cursive style with some letters joined  Without proper rendering support  you may see unjoined Arabic letters

in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia on the Persian Gulf  bordering Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the south  as well as sharing sea borders with Qatar to the west and Iran to the north  The UAE is a federation of seven emirates  equivalent to principalities   each governed by a hereditary emir  with a single national president  The constituent emirates are Abu Dhabi  Ajman  Dubai  Fujairah  Ras al Khaimah  Sharjah  and Umm al Quwain  The capital is Abu Dhabi  which is also the state s center of political  industrial  and cultural activities  9  Prior to independence in 1971  the UAE was known as the Trucial States or Trucial Oman  in reference to a 19th century truce between the local sheikhs  hereditary rulers of the territories  and the United Kingdom  The term Pirate Coast was also used by some to refer to the emirates from the 18th to the early 20th century  owing to the preponderance of pirates operating from Emirati ports  10  The UAE s political system  is based on its 1971 Constitution  which is composed of several intricately connected governing bodies  As a federation of seven monarchies  whose rulers retain absolute power within their emirates  but with a UAE president  it is neither a constitutional monarchy nor a republic  The emirs choose one of their members to be the president of the federation  but this does not alter the monarchical character of the government of the individual emirates  The constitution is concerned solely with the relations between the emirates as members of the federation  and does not prescribe a constitutional system of government  Islam is the official religion of the UAE  and Arabic is the official language  11  UAE oil reserves are ranked as the world s sixth largest 12  and it possesses one of the most developed economies in West Asia  It is the thirty fifth largest economy at market exchange rates  and ranks among the world s wealthiest nations with per capita GDP  PPP  of US 48 597  13  It is 15th in purchasing power per capita and has a relatively high Human Development Index for the Asian continent  ranking thirtieth globally  14  The UAE is classified as a high income developing economy by the IMF  Contents 1 History 1 1 Advent of Islam 1 2 Portuguese control 1 3 European domination 1 4 Pearling industry 1 5 Beginning of the oil era 1 6 Zayed bin Sultan Al

Hatta The earliest known human habitation in the UAE dated from 5500 BC  At this early stage  there is proof of interaction with the outside world  particularly with civilizations to the north in Persia  These contacts persisted and became wide ranging  probably motivated by trade in copper from the Hajar Mountains  which commenced around 3000 BC  15 Foreign trade  the recurring motif in the history of this strategic region  flourished also in later periods  facilitated by the domestication of the camel at the end of the second millennium BC  16  By the 1st century AD overland caravan traffic between Syria and cities in southern Iraq began  Also  there was seaborne travel to the important port of Omana  present day Umm al Qaiwain  and then to India  These routes were an alternative to the Red Sea route used by the Romans  17 Pearls had been exploited in the area for millennia but at this time the trade reached new heights  Seafaring was also a mainstay and major fairs were held at Dibba  bringing in merchants from as far as China  18   edit  Advent of Islam The arrival of envoys from the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 630 heralded the conversion of the region to Islam  After Muhammad  one of the major battles of the Ridda Wars was fought at Dibba resulting in the defeat of the non Muslims and the triumph of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula  In 637  Julfar  today Ra s al Khaimah  was used as a staging post for the conquest of Iran  Over many centuries  Julfar became a wealthy port and pearling center from which dhows travelled throughout the Indian Ocean especially to neighboring land of Sindh and its cities of Thatta and Debal   edit  Portuguese control See also  History of Oman and Economic history of Portugal Portuguese expansion into the Indian Ocean in the early 16th century following Vasco da Gama s route of exploration saw them battle Safavid Persia up the coast of the Persian Gulf  The Portuguese controlled the area for 150 years  in which they conquered the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula  19  Vasco da Gama was helped by Ahmad Ibn Majid  a navigator and cartographer from Julfar  to find the spice route from Asia  20  21   edit  European domination During the 16th century  piecemeal  the entire territory of the nation came under the direct influence of the European colonial empires  with the British eventually getting the upper hand  The region was known to the British as the  Pirate Coast   as raiders based there harassed the shipping industry despite both European and Arab navies patrolling the area from the 17th century into the 19th  22  British expeditions to protect the Indian trade from raiders at Ras al Khaimah led to campaigns against that headquarters and other harbours along the coast in 1819  The next year  a peace treaty was signed to which all the sheikhs of the coast adhered  Raids continued intermittently until 1835  when the sheikhs agreed not to engage in hostilities at sea  In 1853  they signed a treaty with the British  under which the sheikhs  the  Trucial Sheikhdoms   agreed to a  perpetual maritime truce   It was enforced by the United Kingdom  and disputes among sheikhs were referred to the British for settlement  23  Flag of the Trucial Coast Primarily in reaction to the ambitions of other European countries  the United Kingdom and the Trucial Sheikhdoms established closer bonds in an 1892 treaty  similar to treaties entered into by Britain with other principalities in the Persian Gulf  The sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to Britain and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the United Kingdom without its consent  In return  the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack  24  British suppression of piracy meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security  However  the British prohibition of the slave trade meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants  25   edit  Pearling industry During the 19th and early 20th centuries  the pearling industry thrived in the relative calm sea  providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf  It began to become a good economic resource for the local people  Then the First World War had a severe impact on the pearl fishery  but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s  coupled with the Japanese invention of the cultured pearl  that all but destroyed it  The industry eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War  when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the Arab states of the Persian Gulf  26  The decline of pearling resulted in a very difficult era  with little opportunity to build any infrastructure  Dubai in the mid 20th century  edit  Beginning of the oil era At the beginning of the 1960s  the first oil company teams carried out preliminary surveys and the first cargo of crude was exported from Abu Dhabi in 1962  As oil revenues increased  ruler of Abu Dhabi  Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan  undertook a massive construction program  building schools  housing  hospitals and roads  When Dubai s oil exports commenced in 1969  Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum  the de facto ruler of Dubai  was also able to use oil revenues to improve the quality of life of his people  27  In 1955  the United Kingdom sided with Abu Dhabi in the latter s dispute with Oman over the Buraimi Oasis  another territory to the south  28  A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia would have settled the Abu Dhabi Saudi border dispute  however  the agreement has yet to be ratified by the UAE government and is not recognized by the Saudi government  The border with Oman also remains officially unsettled  but the two governments agreed to delineate the border in May 1999  29  Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan  edit  Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and the union In the early 1960s  oil was discovered in Abu Dhabi  an event that led to quick unification calls made by UAE sheikdoms  Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan became ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966 and the British started losing their oil investments and contracts to U S  oil companies  30  The British had earlier started a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates  The sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office  They formed the Trucial States Council  31  and appointed Adi Bitar  Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum s legal advisor  as Secretary General and Legal Advisor to the Council  The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed  32  In 1968  the United Kingdom announced its decision  reaffirmed in March 1971  to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial Sheikhdoms which had been  together with Bahrain and Qatar  under British protection  The nine attempted to form a union of Arab emirates  but by mid 1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union  even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year  33  Bahrain became independent in August  and Qatar in September 1971  When the British Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on December 1  1971  they became fully independent  34  The rulers of Abu Dhabi and Dubai decided to form a union between their two emirates independently  prepare a constitution  then call the rulers of the other five emirates to a meeting and offer them the opportunity to join  It was also agreed between the two that the constitution be written by December 2  1971  35  On that date  at the Dubai Guesthouse Palace  four other emirates agreed to enter into a union called the United Arab Emirates  Ras al Khaimah joined later  in early 1972  36  37  The UAE supported military operations from the United States and other Coalition nations that are engaged in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan  2001  and Saddam Hussein in Iraq  2003  as well as operations supporting the Global War on Terrorism for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base located outside of Abu Dhabi  citation needed  The air base also supported Allied operations during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and Operation Northern Watch  The country had already signed a military defense agreement with the U S  in 1994 and one with France in 1995  citation needed  On 2 November 2004  the UAE s first president  Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan  died  His eldest son  Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan  succeeded as Emir of Abu Dhabi  In accordance with the constitution  the UAE s Supreme Council of Rulers elected Khalifa as president  Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan succeeded Khalifa as Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi  38  In January 2006  Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum  the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai  died  and the crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum assumed both roles   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of the United Arab Emirates Geography of the UAE Coastline 1 318 km  819 miles  Bordering countries Saudi Arabia  and Oman The landscape of Sir Bani Yas Island The United Arab Emirates is situated in Southwest Asia  bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf  between Oman and Saudi Arabia  it is in a strategic location along southern approaches to the Strait of Hormuz  a vital transit point for world crude oil  39  A view of the desert landscape on the outskirts of Dubai The mountainous region in the north The UAE lies between 22 30  and 26 10  north latitude and between 51  and 56 25  east longitude  It shares a 530 kilometer border with Saudi Arabia on the west  south  and southeast  and a 450 kilometer border with Oman on the southeast and northeast  The land border with Qatar in the Khawr al Udayd area is about nineteen kilometers in the northwest  however  it is a source of ongoing dispute  40  Additionally  island disputes with Iran and Qatar remain unresolved  41  The largest emirate  Abu Dhabi  accounts for 87  of the UAE s total area  67 340 square kilometers   The smallest emirate  Ajman  encompasses only 259 square kilometers  see figure   The UAE coast stretches for more than 650 kilometers along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf  Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend far inland  The largest natural harbor is at Dubai  although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi  Sharjah  and elsewhere  Numerous islands which   are found in the Persian Gulf  and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar  The smaller islands  as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars  are a menace to navigation  Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore  The UAE also has a stretch of the Al B  inah coast of the Gulf of Oman  although the Musandam Peninsula  the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz is an enclave of Oman within the UAE  South and west of Abu Dhabi  vast  rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub al Khali  Empty Quarter  of Saudi Arabia  The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation  The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia  About 100 kilometers to the northeast of Liwa is the Al Buraimi oasis  which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi Oman border  Prior to withdrawing from the area in 1971  Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation  In general  the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention  but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai  and also between Dubai and Sharjah  conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent  The most complicated borders were in the Al Hajar al Gharbi Mountains  where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves   edit  Flora and fauna Acacia trees growing in desert suburbs near Fujairah The oases grow date palms  acacia and eucalyptus trees  In the desert the flora is very sparse and consists of grasses and thornbushes  The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting  which has led to a conservation program on Bani Yas island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s  resulting in the survival of  for example  Arabian oryx and leopards  Coastal fish and mammals consist mainly of mackerel  perch and tuna  as well as sharks and whales   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of the United Arab Emirates The climate of the U A E is subtropical arid with hot summers and warm winters  The hottest months are July and August  when average maximum temperatures reach above 40  C  104 0  F  on the coastal plain  In the Al Hajar Mountains  temperatures are considerably lower  a result of increased altitude  42  Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between 10 and 14  C  50 and 57 2  F   43  During the late summer months  a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi  i e   Easterner   makes the coastal region especially unpleasant  The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than 120 mm  4 7 in   but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches 350 mm  13 8 in   Rain in the coastal region falls in short  torrential bursts during the summer months  sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds  44  The region is prone to occasional  violent dust storms  which can severely reduce visibility  The Jebel Jais mountain cluster in

The politics of the United Arab Emirates take place in a framework of a federal  presidential system of a federation of absolute hereditary monarchies  The UAE is a federation of seven absolute monarchies  the emirates of Abu Dhabi  Ajman  Fujairah  Sharjah  Dubai  Ras al Khaimah and Umm al Qaiwain  The President of the United Arab Emirates is its head of state  and the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates is its head of government  47  including foreign affairs  security and defense  nationality and immigration issues  education  public health  currency  postal  telephone and other communications services  air traffic control  licensing of aircraft  labor relations  banking  delimitation of territorial waters and extradition of criminals  All responsibilities not granted to the national government are reserved to the emirates  The UAE government comprises three branches  the executive  legislature  and judiciary  The executive branch consists of the President  Vice President  Prime Minister  Federal Supreme Council  and a Council of Ministers  the cabinet   The Federal Supreme Council is composed of the emirs of the seven emirates  It elects the president  vice president  members of the Council of Ministers  and judges of the Federal Supreme Court  The Supreme Council also formulates government policy  proposes and ratifies national laws  and ratifies treaties  Although elected by the Supreme Council  the president and prime minister are essentially hereditary  The emir of Abu Dhabi holds the presidency  and the emir of Dubai is prime minister  All but one prime minister served concurrently as vice president  The political influences and financial obligations of the emirates are reflected by their respective positions in the federal government  While each emirate still retains autonomy over its own territory  a percentage of its revenue is allocated to the UAE s central budget  48  Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was the UAE s president from the nation s founding until his death on November 2  2004  On the following day the Federal Supreme Council elected his son  Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan  to the post  Abu Dhabi s crown prince  Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan  is the heir apparent  49  The legislature is the Federal National Council  FNC   which consists of 40 members drawn from all the emirates  Half are appointed by the rulers of the constituent emirates  and the other half are indirectly elected to serve two year terms  The first indirect elections took place in 2006  and the goal is a wholly elected council  The council carries out the country s main consultative duties and has both a legislative and supervisory role provided by the constitution  50  The council scrutinizes and amends proposed legislation  but cannot prevent it from becoming law  The main tasks of the FNC are  Discussing constitutional amendments and draft laws  which may be approved  amended or rejected Reviewing the annual draft budget of the federation Debating international treaties and conventions Influencing the Government s work through the channels of discussion  question and answer sessions  recommendations and following up on complaints A constitutionally independent judiciary includes the Federal Supreme Court  51  However  Dubai and Ras al Khaimah do not belong to the national judiciary  All emirates have their own secular and Islamic law for civil  criminal  and high courts  52  In parallel to the economic developments of the UAE  the country s leaders have also initiated political reforms in order to further develop the political institutions  The political modernization process was envisaged in three stages  first  conduct elections to elect half the FNC members through an Electoral College  second expand the powers of the FNC and increase the number of FNC members  which would require extensive constitutional studies and possible modifications  at the end of which the political institution would be a more enabled body  and finally  an open election for half the council  The purpose of the elections was to expand political participation and develop a culture of government reform  The limited scope of participation was conditioned by three reasons   1  the country not having an electoral tradition   2  the prevailing political tension and instability in the region meaning that there was no scope for error  and  3  elections in the region having proved to potentially be divisive affairs  based on sectarian and religious issues  which the UAE wanted to avoid  In December 2008  the Supreme Council approved constitutional amendments both to empower the FNC and to enhance government transparency and accountability  53  United Arab Emirates Government The United

Dhabi  Other systems of law are also in practice  such as in Abu Dhabi where an Open Court is held every Sunday  In Open Court  locals seek the aid of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and his court

of occupation  freedom to be elected to office and others onto all citizens  within the limit of the law  55  Because of the rapid development of the UAE from a traditional society in the mid 20th century to a modernizing one at the beginning of the 21st century  the concurrent development of legal provisions and the practical enforcement of existing laws has been challenging and  in consequence  problems exist mainly in regard to human rights of non citizens  who make up around 80  of the population  Main issues include companies  and employers  non compliance with labor laws  Many expatriate workers  mostly of South Asian origin  have after their arrival in the UAE been turned into debt ridden de facto indentured servants  56  Confiscation of passports  although illegal  occurs on a large scale  primarily of unskilled or semi skilled employees  57  The UAE s system of employment for non citizens ties an employee to the employer and prevents him or her from seeking alternative employment without the express approval of the original employer  Also  among employers of foreign labourers non payment of wages  cramped and unsanitary living conditions and poor health and safety practices are widespread and have been the subject of foreign media attention  Labourers often toil in intense heat with temperatures reaching 54 degrees celsius  129 degrees Fahrenheit  in the cities in August  Temperatures in the desert can be higher  Official temperatures are censored during the summer months   this is a common practice among all Gulf countries  58  Although attempts have been made since 2009 to enforce a midday break rule  these are frequently flouted and apply only to a narrow section of labourers   only those who work in direct sunlight  which neglects the vast majority  for example  those who work on construction sites without air conditioning or even adequate ventilation  Those labourers who do receive a midday break often have no suitable place to rest and are seen seeking shade under bridges or palm trees  where outdoor temperatures remain intolerable  59  In order to institutionalize the fight against human trafficking  including that of expatriate workers for blue collar jobs  the UAE government has devised a four pillar strategy   1  legislation   2  enforcement  3  victim support  and  4  bilateral agreements and international cooperation  In 2007 the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking was established  which serves as a coordinating agency  The UAE has ratified the United Nations Protocol to Prevent  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons  especially Women and Children  Palermo Protocol   The victim support program includes protection  counseling and rehabilitation  Police departments and non Government organizations provide shelter and support for human trafficking victims until they are able to acquire the right documents and many victims are then sent home at the Government s expense  under the Crime Victim Assistance Programme  These shelters include the Dubai Women s and Children s Foundation  which was established in July 2007  and Ewaa in Abu Dhabi  which opened in late 2008  as well as the Human Rights Care Department in Dubai and the Social Support Centre in Abu Dhabi  which have been operating for several years  53  The issue of sexual abuse among female domestic servants is an area of concern  particularly given that domestic servants are not covered by the UAE Labor Law of 1980 or the Draft Labor Law of 2007  60  Worker protests have been cracked down on  61  Until today  the government has not allowed for trade unions to form despite having promised to do so since 2004  62  As Sharia prohibits sodomy  homosexual relationships are not commonly disclosed  The UAE is much more moderate on homosexual punishment than many of its neighbors  citation needed  The death penalty is never implemented for homosexuality  and rarely life imprisonment  citation

protection of human rights  citation needed  For example  in 2004  the Dubai police opened designated departments in all emirate police stations that are mandated to protect the human rights of both victims and perpetrators of crime  67  UN rapporteurs   one on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography  and the other on contemporary forms of racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia and related intolerance   visited the UAE separately and held discussions with various ministries  civil society organizations  academics and ordinary citizens  Commending the Government s  cooperation and openness   a preliminary report of the rapporteur on racism said   The recent review of the UAE by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and by the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council demonstrates that the authorities are willing to find ways and means of addressing human rights challenges faced by the people in the UAE and to ensure compliance with international human rights standards   Efforts are under way to promulgate a draft national law for better protection of children  in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child  The proposed law provides for the establishment of a hotline to respond to children s problems and encourages the establishment of associations or clubs specializing in child affairs  as well as calling for the appointment of a special judge to handle cases related to children  53  The UAE National Human Rights Report  prepared by a committee comprising representatives from various ministries and government institutions  with the participation of representatives from civil society and non governmental organizations  NGOs   and presented to the UN Human Rights Council on 4 December 2008 outlines efforts in the field of human rights observance and listed challenges facing the country  such as the following  Providing more mechanisms to protect human rights  keeping up with national and international developments  and updating laws and systems Meeting the state s expectations with regards to building national capabilities and deepening efforts for education on human rights and basic freedoms through a national plan Striving to regulate the relationship between employers and workers in framework that preserves dignity and rights  and is in harmony with

private schools which are internationally accredited  Public schools in the country are free for citizens of the UAE  while the fees for private schools vary  There has been significant improvement in private education across the UAE  This is particularly important given the fact that a relatively high percentage of students in the Emirates are enrolled in private schools  in Dubai 50  of all students are in private schools  while the number for Abu Dhabi stands at around 40   Many private international schools in the UAE are accredited by international bodies and there are currently 17

unlike Abu Dhabi and Dubai  do not have separate healthcare authorities  The strategy focuses on unifying healthcare policy and improving access to healthcare services at reasonable cost  at the same time reducing dependence on overseas treatment  The ministry plans to add three hospitals to the current 14  and 29 primary healthcare centres to the current 86  Nine were scheduled to open in 2008  104  The introduction of mandatory health insurance in Abu Dhabi for expatriates and their dependents was a major driver in reform of healthcare policy  Abu Dhabi nationals were brought under the scheme from 1 June 2008 and Dubai followed for its government employees  Eventually  under federal law  every Emirati and expatriate in the country will be covered by compulsory health insurance under a unified mandatory scheme  105  Recently the country has been benefiting from medical tourists from all over the GCC  The UAE currently attracts medical tourists seeking plastic surgery and advanced

the construction of Dubailand  which is expected to be twice the size of Disney World  and of Dubai Sports City which will not only provide homes for local sports teams but may be part of future Olympic bids  However  this is concern that this construction boom has been built on debt and speculation  with little creation of true economic value  Major increases in imports occurred in manufactured goods  machinery  and transportation equipment  which together accounted for 80  of total imports  Another important foreign exchange earner  the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority   which

 The allocation will be used to fund the construction of road networks  new housing communities  drainage networks and other projects  providing integrated solutions to some infrastructure deficits in these areas  121  The United Arab Emirates has an extensive road network that connects all major cities and towns  Roads in the western and southern regions are still relatively undeveloped  Those are highly dangerous roads passing through desert regions and many are still unsealed  gravel roads  This has resulted in the continued use of airplanes as the main or alternative mode of transportation for the residents  122  There are seaports throughout the country  The major ports are Port Jebel Ali  Port Rashid  Port Khalid  Port Saeed  Port Khor Fakkan  and Port Zayed  123  The UAE contains a

Arab Emirates has a diverse and multicultural society  139  The country s cultural imprint as a small  ethnically homogenous pearling community was changed with the arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals first by the Iranians in the early 1900s  and later by Indians and Pakistanis in the 1960s  Despite the diversity of the population  only minor and infrequent episodes of ethnic tensions have been reported in the country  Major holidays in Dubai include Eid al Fitr  which marks the end of Ramadan  and National Day  2 December   which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates  140  Emirati culture mainly revolves around the religion of Islam and traditional Arab  and Bedouin culture  The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on the region s architecture  music  attire  cuisine and lifestyle are very prominent as well  Five times every day  Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country  141  Since 2006  the weekend has been Friday Saturday  as a compromise between Friday s holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday Sunday  142  This unique socioeconomic development in the Persian Gulf has meant that the UAE is relatively liberal  While Islam is the main religion  the UAE has been known for its tolerant practices  Christian churches can be found alongside mosques and this courtesy has seemingly been extended to Hinduism and Sikhism as there is a place tucked away inside a residential style building which houses a Hindu temple and a Sikh gurudwara  There is evidently no persecution of Hindus or Sikhs which is why it is home to several communities that have faced persecution elsewhere  who are now contributing to the cosmopolitan atmosphere  There are a variety of Asian influenced schools  cultural centers and restaurants  Increasing numbers of European centers  schools  and restaurants can also be seen in the UAE   edit  Dress and etiquette Most Emirati males prefer to wear a kandura  an ankle length white tunic woven from wool or cotton  and most Emirati women wear an abaya  a black over garment covering most parts of the body  143  Western style clothing is  however  dominant because of the large expatriate population  and this practice is beginning to grow in popularity among Emiratis  Etiquette is an important aspect of UAE culture and tradition  to which visitors are expected to conform  Recently  many expatriates have disregarded the law and been arrested for indecent clothing at beaches  144  Western style dress is tolerated in appropriate places  such as bars or clubs  but the UAE has maintained a strict policy of protecting highly public spaces from cultural insensitivity  This is due  in large part  to the effects such practices are considered to have on the social integration and participation of a largely conservative Emirati population   edit  Food Main article  Emirati cuisine See also  Arab cuisine The traditional food of the Emirates has always

with cardamom  saffron  or mint to give them a distinct flavor  145  Muslims are prohibited from eating pork  so it is not included in local menus  Hotels frequently have pork substitutes such as beef sausages and veal rashers on their breakfast menus  If pork is available  it is clearly labeled as such  Alcohol is generally only served in hotel restaurants and bars  but not in Sharjah   All
