sometimes abbreviated as EW  is an American magazine  published by the Time division of Time Warner  that covers film  television  music  broadway theatre  books and popular culture  Unlike celebrity focused publications Us Weekly  People Weekly  and In Touch Weekly  EW s primary concentration is on entertainment media news and critical reviews  Unlike Variety and The Hollywood Reporter  which are aimed at industry insiders  EW targets a more general audience  Contents 1 History 2 Typical content and frequency 2 1 Layout 2 1 1 News and Notes 2 1 2 Feature articles 2 1 3 Reviews 2 1 4 The

publisher until October 2007 1   the magazine s original television advertising soliciting pre publication subscribers portrayed it as a consumer guide to popular culture  including movies  music  and book reviews  sometimes with video game and stage reviews  too    the post modern Farmers  Almanac    clarification needed  The first issue was published on February 16  1990  and featured singer k d  lang on its cover  The title word  entertainment  was not capitalized on the cover until mid 1992 and has remained so since  By 2003  the magazine s weekly circulation averaged 1 7 million copies per week  In March 2006  managing editor Rick Tetzeli oversaw an overhaul of EW s graphics and layout to reflect a more modern look  citation needed   edit  Typical content and frequency The magazine features celebrities on the cover and addresses topics such as television ratings  movie grosses  production costs  concert ticket sales  ad budgets  and in depth articles about scheduling  producers  showrunners  etc  It publishes several  double issues  each year  usually in January  May  June and or August  that are available on newsstands for two weeks  because the magazine numbers its issues sequentially  it counts each double issue as  two  issues so that it can fulfil its marketing claim of 52 issues per year for subscribers   edit  Layout Cover of Entertainment Weekly issue Volume 1  Number 1  dated February 16  1990  Featured on the cover is the singer k d  lang  Entertainment Weekly follows a typical magazine format by featuring a letters to the editor and table of contents in the first few pages  while also featuring advertisements  While many advertisements are unrelated to the entertainment industry  the majority of ads are typically related to up and coming television  film or music events   edit  News and Notes These beginning articles open the magazine and as a rule focus on current events in pop culture  The whole section typically runs eight to ten pages long  and features short news articles  as well as several specific recurring sections   The Must List  is a two page spread highlighting ten things  books  movies  songs  etc   that the staff loves from the week  it usually features one pick from EW readers   First Look   subtitled  An early peek at some of Hollywood s coolest projects   is a two page spread with behind the scenes or publicity stills of upcoming movies  television episodes or music events   The Shaw Report  is a small sidebar feature  written by Jessica Shaw that rates several trios of related trends  one that is  in   one that is  five minutes ago   recently fashionable but no longer so   and one that is  out    The Hit List   written each week by critic Scott Brown  highlights ten major events  with short comedic commentaries by Brown  Typically  there will be some continuity to the commentaries  This column was originally written by Jim Mullen and featured twenty events each week  and Dalton Ross later wrote an abbreviated version   The Hollywood Insider  is a one page section that reports breaking news in entertainment  It gives details  in the separate columns  on the most current news in television  movie and music   The Style Report  is a one page section devoted to celebrity style  Because its focus is on celebrity fashion or lifestyle  it is graphically rich in nature  featuring many photographs or other images  Recently  clarification needed  the page converted to a new format  five pictures of celebrity fashions for the week  graded on the magazine s review  A  to  F  scale  see Reviews section below   A spin off section   Style Hunter   which finds reader requested articles of clothing or accessories that have appeared in pop culture recently  appears frequently   The Monitor  is a two page spread devoted to major events in celebrity lives with small paragraphs highlighting events such as weddings  illnesses  arrests  court appearances  and deaths  Deaths of major celebrities are typically detailed in a one half  or full page obituary titled  Legacy   This feature is nearly identical to sister publication People s  Passages  feature  The  celebrity  column  the final section of  News and Notes   is devoted to a different column each week  written by two of the magazine s more prominent writers   The Final Cut  is written by former executive editor and author Mark Harris  Harris  column focuses on analyzing current popular culture events  and is generally the most serious of the columns  Harris has written about the writer s strike and the 2008 presidential election  among other topics   Binge Thinking  was written by screenwriter Diablo Cody  After several profiles of Cody in the months leading up to and following the release of her debut film  Juno  2007   she was hired to write a column detailing her unique view of the entertainment business  If You Ask Me     Libby Gelman Waxer  Paul Rudnick  was brought in to write his former Premiere Magazine column for Entertainment Weekly in 2011   2   edit  Feature articles There are typically four to six major articles  one to two pages each  within the middle pages of the magazine  These articles are most commonly interviews  but there are also narrative articles as well as lists  Feature articles tend to focus mostly on movies  music and television and less on books and the theatre  In the magazine s history  there have only been a few cover stories  e g   John Grisham  Stephen King  devoted to authors  there has never been a cover solely devoted to the theater   edit  Reviews There are seven sections of reviews in the back pages of each issue  together encompassing up to one half of the magazine s pages   In addition to reviews  each reviews section has a top sellers list  as well as numerous sidebars with interviews or small features  Unlike a number of European magazines that give their ratings with a number of stars  with normally 4 or 5 stars for the best review   EW grades the reviews academic style  so that the highest reviews will get a letter grade of  A  and the lowest reviews get an  F   with plus or minus graduations in between assigned to each letter except  F   The sections are   Movies  typically features all the major releases for that weekend  as well as several independent and foreign films that have also been released  Lisa Schwarzbaum and Owen Gleiberman are the two primary film critics  with occasional reviews by Scott Brown and Gregory Kirschling  It also includes  Critical Mass    a table of the grades that have also been given by a number of noted movie reviewers in the American press  such as Ty Burr from The Boston Globe  Todd McCarthy from Variety and Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun Times   Additionally  this section includes the box office figures from the previous weekend and some sort of infographic  The A  rating is rarely awarded by EW  Two films to have received it are Citizen Kane and My Left Foot  1989   DVDs are now profiled in the one page  Movies on DVD  section that follows   Television  features reviews by chief critic Ken Tucker for made for television films and new television program or series  as well as some television specials  There is also a section of sound bites featuring quotations from various television shows  The section also includes the Nielsen ratings for the previous week  On the following page is typically a  TV on DVD  section  profiling releases of television films and specials or complete seasons of television shows   What to Watch   currently written by Jessica Shaw  features brief  one  or two sentence reviews of several television programs on each night of the week  as well as one slightly longer review  usually written by someone else  with a letter grade   Music  reviews major album releases for the week  divided by genre  There is also typically at least one interview or feature  as well as a section called  Download This   highlighting several singles available for download from the Internet  A table displaying record sales and airplay for the previous week is also included   Books  features reviews of books released during the week  Sometimes  authors will write guest reviews of other works  There is also typically one interview or spotlight feature in this section per issue  Bestseller lists appear at the end of this section   Theater   reviews productions currently playing  listed by the city where they are running   Games   reviews current video game releases   Tech   reviews new websites and products  and profiles current Internet or technology phenomena    Not in every issue   edit  The Bullseye This section occupies the back page of the magazine  rating the  hits  and  misses  from the past week s events in popular culture on a bullseye graphic  For example  the May 22  2009  edition featured Justin Timberlake hosting Saturday Night Live in the center  while the then drama between Eminem and Mariah Carey missed the target completely for being  very 2002   At the time when this was printed on a small part of a page  events that were greatly disliked were shown several pages away   edit  Specialty issues Every year the magazine publishes several specialty issues  These issues are often published as double issues  running for two consecutive weeks   Many times these features are so long that they replace all other feature articles  Common specialty issues include  Spring  Summer  Fall and Winter Preview issues   Generally each quarter the magazine reports on upcoming releases in movies  music  television  live shows and books  Typically the summer issue s focus will be on upcoming movies only unless major television series or events  music releases or book releases are occurring then  The Photo issue   Once a year  an issue is dedicated to featuring  aside from the normal reviews and news content  only photographs of celebrities  Unlike tabloid issues  these photographs done with the celebrities  cooperation  and often they use some form of artistic expression  A wide variety of celebrities have been used  including Green Day  Reese Witherspoon  Morrissey  the cast of the television series Arrested Development  Tobey Maguire and Cameron Diaz  Generally  the photographs will contain some descriptive text  sometimes about the person or sometimes a commentary from the photographers who photographed them for a story  Academy Awards issues   In the past the magazine devoted at least four cover stories per year to the Academy Awards   The Oscar Race Begins  issue in January predicts the nominees  the  Nominees  issue in February profiles the recently announced Oscar contenders  the  Oscar Odds  issue predicts the winners the week before the awards  and the  After Awards  issue covers the ceremony the week after it airs  Virtually every issue mentions the Oscars in some capacity  often on the cover  and a film or actor s Academy Award chances are often noted in the magazine s reviews  In comparison  music s Grammy Awards  television s Emmy Awards  and theater s Tony Awards are given relatively limited coverage  List of Oscar Nomination Predictions LIST 1996 Year Category
