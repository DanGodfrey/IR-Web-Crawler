and north of Australia  The region lies on the intersection of geological plates  with heavy seismic and volcanic activity  Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions  Mainland Southeast Asia  also known as Indochina  comprises Cambodia  Laos  Burma  Myanmar   Thailand  Vietnam and Peninsular Malaysia  and Maritime Southeast Asia  which is analogous to the Malay Archipelago  comprises

Austronesian peoples predominate in this region  The major religions are Buddhism and Islam  followed by Christianity  However  a wide variety of religions are found throughout the region  including many Hindu and animist influenced practices  29  Contents 1 Divisions 1 1 Political 1 1 1 Countries 1 1 2 Territories 1 1 3 Administrative subdivisions of countries 1 2 Geographical 2 History 2 1

shows the influence of Indian culture in Southeast Asia  also through trade  Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45 000 years ago  having moved eastward from the Indian subcontinent  42 Homo floresiensis seems to have shared some islands with modern humans until only 12 000 years ago  when they became extinct  43  One theory  which has received much criticism in recent years is that Austronesian people  who form the majority of the modern population in Indonesia  Malaysia  Brunei  East Timor  and the Philippines  migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan  They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE  and as they spread through the archipelago  confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions  44  Contrary to the above  studies presented by HUGO  Human Genome Organization  through genetic studies of the Asian races  scientifically points out to a single Asian migration from Southeast Asia travelling northwards slowly populating Southern parts of East Asia and then East Asia itself instead of the other way around  45  Solheim and others have shown evidence for a Nusantao  Nusantara  maritime trading network ranging from Vietnam to the rest of the archipelago as early as 5000 BCE to 1 CE  46  The peoples of Southeast Asia  especially those of Austronesian descent  have been seafarers for thousands of years  some reaching the island of Madagascar  Their vessels  such as the vinta  were ocean worthy  Magellan s voyage records how much more maneuvreable their vessels were  as compared to the European ships  47  Passage through the Indian Ocean aided the colonization of Madagascar by the Austronesian people  as well as commerce between West Asia and Southeast Asia  Gold from Sumatra is thought to have reached as far west as Rome  while a slave from the Sulu Sea was believed to have been used in Magellan s voyage as a translator  Originally most people were animist  This was later replaced by Hinduism  Theravada Buddhism soon followed in 525  In 15th century  Islamic influences began to enter  This forced the last Hindu court in Indonesia to retreat to Bali  In Mainland Southeast Asia  Burma  Cambodia and Thailand retained the Theravada form of Buddhism  brought to them from Sri Lanka  This type of Buddhism was fused with the Hindu influenced Khmer culture  Architecture in the Srivijayan style  Surat Thani  Thailand  edit  Indianized kingdoms Main article  Greater India Very little is known about Southeast Asian religious beliefs and practices before the advent of Indian merchants and religious influences from the 2nd century BCE onwards  Prior to the 13th century CE  Hinduism and Buddhism were the main religions in Southeast Asia  The Jawa Dwipa Hindu kingdom in Java and Sumatra existed around 200 BCE  The history of the Malay speaking world begins with the advent of Indian influence  which dates back to at least the 3rd century BCE  Indian traders came to the archipelago both for its abundant forest and maritime products and to trade with merchants from China  who also discovered the Malay world at an early date  Both Hinduism and Buddhism were well established in the Malay Peninsula by the beginning of the 1st century CE  and from there spread across the archipelago  Angkor Wat  in Siem Reap  Cambodia  is the largest religious temple in the world and Angkor the largest pre industrial city in the world Cambodia was first influenced by Hinduism during the beginning of the Funan kingdom  Hinduism was one of the Khmer Empire s official religions  Cambodia is the home to one of the only two temples dedicated to Brahma in the world  Angkor Wat is also a famous Hindu temple of Cambodia  The Champa civilization was located in what is today central Vietnam  and was a highly indianized Hindu Kingdom  The Vietnamese committed genocide against the Cham people during the 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa  ransacking and burning Champa  slaughtering thousands of Cham people  and forcibly assimilating them into Vietnamese culture  48  The Majapahit Empire was an Indianized kingdom based in eastern Java from 1293 to around 1500  Its greatest ruler was Hayam Wuruk  whose reign from 1350 to 1389 marked the empire s peak when it dominated other kingdoms in the southern Malay Peninsula  Borneo  Sumatra  and Bali  Various sources such as the Nagarakertagama also mention that its influence spanned over parts of Sulawesi  Maluku  and some areas of western New Guinea  making it the largest empire to ever exist in Southeast Asian history  The Cholas excelled in maritime activity in both military and the mercantile fields  Their raids of Kedah and the Srivijaya  and their continued commercial contacts with the Chinese Empire  enabled them to influence the local cultures  Many of the surviving examples of the Hindu cultural influence found today throughout the Southeast Asia are the result of the Chola expeditions  49   edit  Spread of Islam See also  Spread of Islam in Indonesia Children studying Koran in Java during colonial period  In the 11th century  a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia  the Indian Chola navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram  Kedah   the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive  Along with Kadaram  Pannai in present day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too  Soon after that  the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional Hindu faith  and converted to Islam with the Sultanate of Kedah established in year 1136  Samudera Pasai converted to Islam in the year 1267  the King of Malacca Parameswara married with princess of Pasai  the son became the first sultan of Malacca  soon Malacca became the center of Islam study and maritime trade  other rulers followed suit  Indonesian religious leader and Islamic scholar Hamka  1908 1981  wrote in 1961   The development of Islam in Indonesia and Malaya is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim  Admiral Zheng He   50  There are several theories to the Islamization process in Southeast Asia  The first theory is trade  The expansion of trade among West Asia  India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders brought Islam to the region  The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis  citation needed  The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by syncretising Islamic ideas with existing local beliefs and religious notions  Finally  the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region  The ruler of the region s most important port  Malacca Sultanate  embraced Islam in the 15th century  heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as the religion provided a unifying force among the ruling and trading classes  citation needed   edit  Trade and colonization  edit  China See also  List of tributaries of Imperial China and Imperialism in Asia Chinese merchants have traded with the region for a long time as evidence of Magellan s voyage records that Brunei possessed more cannon than the European ships so it appears that the Chinese fortified them  47  Malaysian legend has it that a Chinese

 is now a tourist attraction there  as is Bukit Cina  where her retinue settled  The strategic value of the Strait of Malacca  which was controlled by Sultanate of Malacca in the 15th and early 16th century  did not go unnoticed by Portuguese writer Duarte Barbosa  who in 1500 wrote  He who is lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice   Strait of Malacca   narrows    edit  Europe Western influence started to enter in the 16th century  with the arrival of the Portuguese and Spanish in Maluku and the Philippines  Later the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies  the French Indochina  and the British Strait Settlements  Later  all Southeast Asian countries were colonized except for Thailand  European explorers were reaching Southeast Asia from the west and from the east  Regular trade between the ships sailing east from the Indian Ocean and south from mainland Asia provided goods in return for natural products  such as honey and hornbill beaks from the islands of the archipelago  Europeans brought Christianity allowing Christian missionaries to become widespread  Thailand also allowed Western scientists to enter its country to develop its own education system as well as start sending Royal members and Thai scholars to get higher education from Europe and Russia   edit  Japan See also  Greater East Asia Co Prosperity Sphere  Slavery in Japan  Japanese

Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon  The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season  The rain forest is the second largest on earth  with the Amazon being the largest   An exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region  where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape  Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like   edit  Environment See also  Southeast Asian coral reefs and Wallace line Wallace s hypothetical line between

Bornean Clouded Leopard can be also found  Six subspecies of the Binturong or bearcat exist in the region  though the one endemic to the island of Palawan is now classed as vulnerable  Tigers of three different subspecies are found on the island of Sumatra  the Sumatran tiger   in peninsular Malaysia  the Malayan tiger   and in Indochina  the Indochinese tiger   all of which are endangered  The

mainly in Indochina  Birds such as the peafowl and drongo live in this subregion as far east as Indonesia  The babirusa  a four tusked pig  can be found in Indonesia as well  The hornbill was prized for its beak and used in trade with China  The horn of the rhinoceros  not part of its skull  was prized in China as well  Komodo Dragons in Komodo National Park The Indonesian Archipelago is split by the Wallace Line  This line runs along what is now known to be a tectonic plate boundary  and separates Asian  Western  species from Australasian  Eastern  species  The islands between Java Borneo and Papua form a mixed zone  where both types occur  known as Wallacea  As the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in Southeast Asia  concern has increased regarding the impact of human activity on the region s environment  A significant portion of Southeast Asia  however  has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife  The nations of the region  with only few exceptions  have become aware of the need to maintain forest cover not only to prevent soil erosion but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna  Indonesia  for example  has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose  Even so  such species as the Javan rhinoceros face extinction  with only a handful of the animals remaining in western Java  The shallow waters of the Southeast Asian coral reefs have the highest levels of biodiversity for the world s marine ecosystems  where coral  fish and molluscs abound  According to Conservation International  marine surveys suggest that the marine life diversity in the Raja Ampat area is the highest recorded on Earth  Diversity is considerably greater than any other area sampled in the Coral Triangle composed of Indonesia  Philippines  and Papua New Guinea  The Coral Triangle is the heart of the world s coral reef biodiversity  making Raja Ampat quite possibly the richest coral reef ecosystems in the world  The whale shark  the world s largest species of fish and 6 species of sea turtles can also be found in the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean territories of the Philippines  The trees and other plants of the region are tropical  in some countries where the mountains are tall enough  temperate climate vegetation can be found  These rainforest areas are currently being logged over  especially in Borneo  While Southeast Asia is rich in flora and fauna  Southeast Asia is facing severe deforestation which causes habitat loss for various endangered species such as orangutan and the Sumatran tiger  Predictions have been made that more than 40  of the animal and plant species in Southeast Asia could be wiped out in the 21st century  53  At the same time  haze has been a regular occurrence  The two worst regional hazes were in 1997 and 2006 in which multiple countries were covered with thick haze  mostly caused by  slash and burn  activities in Indonesia  In reaction  several countries in Southeast Asia signed the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution in order to combat haze pollution   edit  Economy Jakarta  the one of the most important business districts in Indonesia Downtown Singapore  Despite small size  the city state has the most vibrant economy in the region  including the world s busiest port  Makati City is the Philippines  business financial capital Even prior to the penetration of European interests  Southeast Asia was a critical part of the world trading system  The Ryukyu Kingdom often participated in maritime trade in Southeast Asia  A wide range of commodities originated in the region  but especially important were such spices as pepper  ginger  cloves  and nutmeg  The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants  but it also brought Europeans to the region  First Spaniards  Manila galleon  and Portuguese  then the Dutch  and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries  The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories  as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities  As a result  the Dutch moved into Indonesia  the British into Malaya  the French into Indochina  and the Spanish and the U S  into the Philippines  A panoramic view of Downtown

textiles  electronic high tech goods such as microprocessors and heavy industrial products such as automobiles  Reserves of oil are also present in the region  Seventeen telecommunications companies have contracted to build a new submarine cable to connect Southeast Asia to the U S  54  This is to avoid disruption of the kind recently caused by the cutting of the undersea cable from Taiwan to the U S  in a recent earthquake  Tourism has been a key factor in economic development for many Southeast Asian countries  especially Cambodia  According to UNESCO   tourism  if correctly conceived  can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet   55  Since the early 1990s   even the non ASEAN nations such as Cambodia  Laos  Vietnam and Burma  where the income derived from tourism is low  are attempting to expand their own tourism industries   56  In 1995  Singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to GDP at over 8   By 1998  those receipts had dropped to less than 6  of GDP while Thailand and Lao PDR increased receipts to over 7   Since 2000  Cambodia has surpassed all other ASEAN countries and generated almost 15  of its GDP from tourism in 2006  57  Indonesia is the only member of G 20 major economies and considered as the largest economy in the region  58  Indonesia s estimated gross domestic

primarily descendants of Austronesian  Tai  and Mon Khmer speaking immigrants who migrated from Southern China during the Bronze Age and Iron Age  there are overlays of Arab  Chinese  Indian  Polynesian and Melanesian genes  There are also large pockets of intermarriage between indigenous Southeast Asians and those of Chinese descent  They form a substantial part of everyday life in countries such as Vietnam  Singapore  Thailand  and the Philippines  Indonesia and Malaysia also has mixed Southeast Asian Chinese populations  Ati woman   the Negritos were the earliest inhabitants

contemporary Vietnamese population originated from the Red River area in the north and may be a mixture of Tai and Malay peoples  citation needed  Added to these major ethnic groups are such less numerous peoples as the Karens  Chins  and Nagas in Burma  who have affinities with other Asiatic peoples  Insular Southeast Asia contains a mixture of descendants of Proto Malay  Nesiot  and Pareoean

Portuguese  Spanish  Chinese  Indian and the indigenous Malay culture  Also Brunei shows a strong influence from Arabia  The Banaue Rice Terraces in Luzon Island  Philippines  Rice paddy agriculture has existed in Southeast Asia for thousands of years  ranging across the subregion  Some dramatic examples of these rice paddies populate the Banaue Rice Terraces in the mountains of Luzon in the Philippines  Maintenance of these paddies is very labor intensive  The rice paddies are well suited to the monsoon climate of the region  Stilt houses can be found all over Southeast Asia  from Thailand and Laos  to Borneo  to Luzon in the Philippines  to Papua New Guinea  The region has diverse metalworking  especially in Indonesia  This include weaponry  such as the distinctive kris  and musical instruments  such as the gamelan   edit  Influences The region s chief cultural influences have been from either China or India or both  with Vietnam considered by far the most Chinese influenced  Burma can be said to be influenced equally by both India and China  Western cultural influence is most pronounced in the Philippines  derived particularly from the period of Spanish and American rule  As a rule  the peoples who ate with their fingers were more likely influenced by the culture of India  for example  than the culture of China  where the peoples first ate with chopsticks  tea  as a beverage  can be found across the region  The fish sauces distinctive to the region tend to vary   edit  The arts  Buffalo boy plays a flute     ng H  painting  Vietnam  A Thai boy plays the khim  a traditional Thai instrument similar to the yangqin from China  Khim audio The arts of Southeast Asia have no affinity with the arts of other areas  Dance in much of Southeast Asia also includes movement of the hands  as well as the feet to express the emotion and meaning of dance upon the story that the ballerina going to tell the audience  Most of Southeast Asian confirmed the Dance into their court  according to Cambodian royal ballet represent them in earlier of 7th century before Khmer Empire which highly influenced by Indian Hinduism  Apsara Dance  famous for its strongly hand and feet movement  is a great example of Hindism symbol dance  Puppetry and shadow plays were also a favoured form of entertainment in past centuries as the famous one known as Wayang from Indonesia  The arts and literature in some of Southeast Asia is quite influenced by Hinduism brought to them centuries ago  The Tai  coming late into Southeast Asia  brought with them some Chinese artistic traditions  but they soon shed them in favour of the Khmer and Mon traditions  and the only indications of their earlier contact with Chinese arts were in the style of their temples  especially the tapering roof  and in their lacquerware  In Indonesia  despite conversion to Islam opposed to certain forms of art  they retained many forms of Hindu influenced practices  cultures  arts and literatures  An example will be the  Wayang Kulit  Shadow Puppet  and literatures like the Ramayana  This is also true for mainland Southeast Asia  excluding Vietnam   Dance movements  Hindu gods  arts were also fused into Thai  Khmer  Lao and Burmese cultures  It has been pointed out that Khmer and Indonesian classical arts were concerned with depicting the life of the gods  but to the Southeast Asian mind the life of the gods was the life of the peoples themselves joyous  earthy  yet divine   edit  Music Traditional music in Southeast Asia is as varied as its many ethnic and cultural divisions  Main styles of traditional music can be seen  Court music  folk music  music styles of smaller ethnic groups  and music influenced by genres outside the geographic region  Of the court and folk genres  Gong chime ensembles and orchestras make up the majority  the exception being lowland areas of Vietnam   Gamelan orchestras from Indonesia  Piphat  Pinpeat ensembles of Thailand  amp  Cambodia and the Kulintang ensembles of the southern Philippines  Borneo  Sulawesi and Timor are the three main distinct styles of musical genres that have influenced other traditional musical styles in the region  String instruments also are popular in the region   edit  Writing Main articles  Baybayin  Jawi script  S E A  Write Award  and Thai alphabet Balinese writing on palm leaf  Artifacts can be seen in the Field Museum  Chicago  Illinois  The history of Southeast Asia has led to a wealth of different authors  from both within and without writing about the region  Originally  Indians were the ones who taught the native inhabitants about writing  This is shown through Brahmic forms of writing present in the region such as the Balinese script shown on split palm leaf called lontar  right  The antiquity of this form of writing extends before the invention of paper around the year 100 in China  Note each palm leaf section was only several lines  written longitudinally across the leaf  and bound by twine to the other sections  The outer portion was decorated  The alphabets of Southeast Asia tended to be abugidas  until the arrival of the Europeans  who used words that also ended in consonants  not just vowels  Other forms of official documents  which did not use paper  included Javanese copperplate scrolls  This would have been more durable in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia   edit  See also Southeast Asia portal Asia portal Geography portal Golden Triangle  Southeast Asia  History of Southeast Asia Japanese foreign policy on Southeast Asia List
