century Pannonia was part of the Roman Empire  located within part of later Hungary s territory  Later came the Huns  who built a powerful empire  After Hunnish rule  the Germanic Ostrogoths  Lombards  and Gepids  and the polyethnic Avars  had a presence in the Carpathian Basin  18  In the late 9th century the land was inhabited by Slavic peoples and Avars  On the eve of the arrival of the Hungarians  East Francia  the First Bulgarian Empire and Great Moravia ruled the territory of the Carpathian Basin  Additionally  the Avars formed a significant part of the population of the Carpathian Basin at the end of the 9th century  both contemporary sources 19  20  and a growing number of archaeological evidences suggest that groups of the Avars survived the disintegration of their empire  The freshly unified Magyars  Hungarians  21  led by  rp d settled in the Carpathian Basin starting in 895  20  22  According to linguists  they originated from an ancient Uralic speaking population that formerly inhabited the forested area between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains  23  Medieval Hungary 895 1526 Main article  Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages Hungarian raids

Treaty of Verdun in 843  before the unification of the Anglo Saxon kingdoms  Initially  the rising Principality of Hungary   Western Tourkia  in medieval Greek sources  24  was a state consisting of a semi nomadic people  However  it accomplished an enormous transformation into a Christian realm during the 10th century  This state was well functioning and the nation s military power allowed the Hungarians to conduct successful fierce campaigns and raids from Constantinople to as far as today s Spain  25  The Hungarians defeated no fewer than three major East Frankish Imperial Armies between 907 and 910  26  A later defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 signaled a provisory end to most campaigns on foreign territories  at least towards the West  Age of  rp dian kings Main article   rp d

including probably a part of the Holy Crown of Hungary  currently kept in the Hungarian Parliament  from the papacy  By 1006  Stephen had consolidated his power  and started sweeping reforms to convert Hungary into a Western feudal state  The country switched to using the Latin language  and until as late as 1844  Latin remained the official language of Hungary  Hungary became a powerful kingdom  29 Ladislaus I extended Hungary s frontier in Transylvania and invaded Croatia in 1091  30  31  32  33  The Croatian campaign culminated in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain in 1097 and a personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102  ruled by Coloman  34  The most powerful and wealthiest king of the  rp d dynasty was B la III  who disposed of the equivalent of 23 tonnes of pure silver a year  This exceeded the income of the French king  estimated at 17 tonnes  and was double the receipts of the English Crown  35  Andrew II issued the Diploma Andreanum which secured the special privileges

la IV let Cumans and Jassic people into the depopulated country  who were fleeing the Mongols  38  Over the centuries they were fully assimilated into the Hungarian population  39  As a consequence  after the Mongols retreated  King B la ordered the construction of hundreds of stone castles and fortifications  to defend against a possible second Mongol invasion  The Mongols returned to Hungary in 1285  but the newly built stone castle systems and new tactics  using a higher proportion of heavily armed knights  stopped them  The invading Mongol force was defeated 40  near Pest by the royal army

Budai Nagy Antal Revolt  which was strongly influenced by Hussite ideas  From a small noble family in Transylvania  John Hunyadi grew to become one of the country s most powerful lords  thanks to his outstanding capabilities as a mercenary commander  He was elected governor then regent  He was a successful crusader against the Ottoman Turks  one of his greatest victories being the Siege of Belgrade in 1456  The last strong king of medieval Hungary was the Renaissance king Matthias Corvinus  1458 1490   son of John Hunyadi  His election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted to the Hungarian royal throne without dynastic background  He was a successful military leader and an enlightened patron of the arts and learning  41  His library  the Bibliotheca Corviniana

place in 1717  45  The constrained Habsburg Counter Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to Catholicism  The ethnic composition of Hungary was fundamentally changed as a consequence of the prolonged warfare with the Turks  A large part of the country became devastated  population growth was stunted  and many smaller settlements perished  The main inhabitants of the Ottoman ruled area were ethnically Hungarians  hence their number was substantially diminished  46  The Austrian Habsburg government settled large groups of Serbs and other Slavs in

that East German refugees in Hungary would not be repatriated but would instead be allowed to go to the West  The resulting exodus shook East Germany and hastened the fall of the Berlin Wall  On 23 October  M ty s Sz r s declared Hungary a republic  The majorities in the decisive bodies of the state party agreed to give up their monopoly on power  paving the way for free elections in March 1990  The party s name was changed from the Hungarian Socialist Workers  Party to simply the Hungarian Socialist Party  MSZP  and a new programme advocating social democracy and a free market economy was adopted  This was not enough to shake off the stigma of four decades of autocratic rule  however  and the 1990 election was won by the centre right Hungarian Democratic Forum  MDF   which advocated a gradual transition towards capitalism  The liberal Alliance of Free Democrats  SZDSZ   which had called for much faster change  came second and the Socialist Party trailed far behind  As Gorbachev looked on  Hungary changed political systems with scarcely a murmur and the last Soviet troops left Hungary in June 1991  In coalition with two smaller parties  the MDF provided Hungary with sound government during its hard transition to a full market economy  The economic changes of the early 1990s resulted in declining living standards for most people in Hungary  In 1991 most state subsidies were removed  leading to a severe recession exacerbated by the fiscal austerity necessary to reduce inflation and stimulate investment  This made life difficult for many Hungarians  and in the May 1994 elections the Hungarian Socialist Party led by former Communists won an absolute majority in parliament  All three main political parties advocated economic liberalisation and closer ties with the West  In 1998  the European Union began negotiations with Hungary on full membership  In a 2003 national referendum  85  voted in favour of Hungary joining the European Union  which followed on 1

has continued to demonstrate economic growth as one of the newest member countries of the European Union  since 2004   The private sector accounts for over 80  of GDP  Hungary gets nearly one third of all foreign direct investment flowing into Central Europe  with cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than US 185 billion since 1989  It enjoys strong trade  fiscal  monetary  investment  business  and labor freedoms  The top income tax rate is fairly high  but corporate taxes are low  Inflation is low  it was on the rise in the past few years  but it is now starting to regulate  Investment in Hungary is easy  although it is subject to government licensing in security sensitive areas  Foreign capital enjoys virtually the same protections and privileges as domestic capital  The rule of law is strong  a professional judiciary protects property rights  and the level of corruption is low  The Hungarian economy is a medium sized  structurally  politically  and institutionally open economy in Central Europe and is part of the EU single market  Like most Eastern European economies  it experienced market liberalisation in the early 1990s as part of a transition away from communism  Today  Hungary is a full member of OECD and the World Trade Organization  OECD was the first international organization to accept Hungary as a full member in 1996  after six years of successful cooperation  History of the Hungarian economy Hungarian economy prior to the transition The Hungarian economy prior to World War II was primarily oriented toward agriculture and small scale manufacturing  Hungary s strategic position in Europe and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade  For instance  its largest car manufacturer  Magomobil  maker of the Magosix   produced a total of a few thousand units  83  In the early 1950s  the communist government forced rapid industrialization after the standard Stalinist pattern in an effort to encourage a more self sufficient economy  Most economic activity was conducted by state owned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms  In 1968  Stalinist self sufficiency was replaced by the  New Economic Mechanism   which reopened Hungary to foreign trade  gave limited freedom to the workings of the market  and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector  Although Hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former Eastern bloc  both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the 1970s  and Hungary s net foreign debt rose significantly from  1 billion in 1973 to  15 billion in 1993 due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises  In the face of economic stagnation  Hungary opted to try further liberalization by passing a joint venture law  instating an income tax  and joining the International Monetary Fund  IMF  and the World Bank  By 1988  Hungary had developed a two tier banking system and had enacted significant corporate legislation which paved the way for the ambitious market oriented reforms of the post communist years  Transition to a market economy ING headquarters in Budapest After the fall of communism in Eastern Europe  the former Soviet satellites had to transition from a one party  centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multi party political system  With the collapse of the Soviet Union  the Eastern Bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods  and subsidizing from the Soviet Union  Hungary  for example   lost nearly 70  of its export markets in Eastern and Central Europe   The loss of external markets in Hungary coupled with the loss of Soviet subsidies left  800 000 unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed   84  Another form of Soviet subsidizing that greatly affected Hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programs  Because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures  many social programs in Hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending  As a result  many people in Hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy  Following privatization and tax reductions on Hungarian businesses  unemployment suddenly rose to 12  in 1991  it was 1 7  in 1990    gradually decreasing until 2001  Economic growth  after a fall in 1991 to  11 9   gradually grew until the end of the 1990s at an average annual rate of 4 2   With the stabilization of the new market economy  Hungary has experienced growth in foreign investment with a  cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than  60 billion since 1989   85  The Antall government of 1990 94 began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures  a revamped tax system  and a nascent market based banking system  By 1994  however  the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible  Cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food  medicine  transportation services  and energy  Reduced exports to the former Soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in GDP  Unemployment rose rapidly to about 12  in 1993  The external debt burden  one of the highest in Europe  reached 250  of annual export earnings  while the budget and current account deficits approached 10  of GDP  The devaluation of the currency  in order to support exports   without effective stabilization measures  such as indexation of wages  provoked an extremely high inflation rate  that in 1991 reached 35  and slightly decreased until 1994  growing again in 1995  In March 1995  the government of Prime Minister Gyula Horn implemented an austerity program  coupled with aggressive privatization of state owned enterprises and an export promoting exchange raw regime  to reduce indebtedness  cut the current account deficit  and shrink public spending  By the end of 1997 the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to 4 6  of GDP with public sector spending falling from 62  of GDP to below 50  the current account deficit was reduced to 2  of GDP  and government debt was paid down to 94  of annual export earnings  Megyeri Bridge The Government of Hungary no longer requires IMF financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund  Consequently  Hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms  Hungary s sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investment grade ratings from all major credit rating agencies  although recently the country was downgraded by Moody s  S amp P and remains on negative outlook at Fitch  In 1995 Hungary s currency  the Forint  HUF   became convertible for all current account transactions  and subsequent to OECD membership in 1996  for almost all capital account transactions as well  Since 1995  Hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies  in which the U S  dollar is 30    and the central rate against the basket is devalued at a preannounced rate  originally set at 0 8  per month  the Forint is now an entirely free floating currency  The government privatization program ended on schedule in 1998  80  of GDP is now produced by the private sector  and foreign owners control 70  of financial institutions  66  of industry  90  of telecommunications  and 50  of the trading sector  K r shegy Viaduct After Hungary s GDP declined about 18  from 1990 to 1993 and grew only 1  1 5  up to 1996  strong export performance has propelled GDP growth to 4 4  in 1997  with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving  These successes allowed the government to concentrate in 1996 and 1997 on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system  partly modelled after Chile s pension system with major modifications   reform of higher education  and the creation of a national treasury  Remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation  maintaining stable external balances  and completing structural reforms of the tax system  health care  and local government financing  Recently  the overriding goal of Hungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the European Union  which it joined in late 2004  Hungarian Police HQ  Police Palace  Prior to the change of regime in 1989  65  of Hungary s trade was with Comecon countries  By the end of 1997  Hungary had shifted much of its trade to

largest export market  while Hungary is ranked as the 72nd largest export market for the U S  Bilateral trade between the two countries increased 46  in 1997 to more than  1 billion  The U S  has

in foreign direct investment  FDI  since 1989  Hungary has attracted over one third of all FDI in central and eastern Europe  including the former Soviet Union  Of this  about  6 billion came from American companies  Foreign capital is attracted by skilled and relatively inexpensive labor  tax incentives  modern infrastructure  and a good telecommunications system  By 2006 Hungary s economic outlook had deteriorated  Wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region  however  this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending  This has resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over 10  of GDP and inflation rates predicted to exceed 6   This prompted Nouriel Roubini  a White House economist in the Clinton administration  to state that  Hungary is an accident waiting to happen   86  Hungarian economy today Hungary is a member of the Schengen Area and the EU single market  Hungary  as a member state of the European Union may seek to adopt the common European currency  the Euro  To achieve this  Hungary would need to fulfill the Maastricht criteria  In foreign investments  Hungary has seen a shift from lower value textile and food industry to investment in luxury vehicle production  renewable energy systems  high end tourism  information technology  The austerity measures introduced by the government are in part an attempt to fulfill the Maastricht criteria  The austerity measures include a 2  rise in social security contributions  half of which is paid by employees  and a large increase in the minimum rate of sales tax  levied on food and basic services  from 15 to 20   The Hungarian Central Statistical Office reported a decrease in real wages in the first five months of 2007  Gross average income rose by 7   while net average income increased by 1   When adjusted for inflation  this corresponded to a 7  decline compared with real wages a year before  The drop was due mainly to the 2006 austerity package  however  state measures to combat the black economy may also have had an impact on pay developments  Hungary s low employment rate remains a key structural handicap to achieving higher living standards  The government introduced useful measures in the key areas  namely early retirement  disability and old pensions  2008 2009 financial crisis Hungary  which joined the European Union in 2004  has been hit

such as health care reform  tax reform  and local government financing are being addressed by the present government  General government net lending was 9 2  in 2006  instead of estimated 10 1   but still the largest in Europe  because of the austerity program of the government  and was 5 5  in 2007  and recent estimates of the government says 4  in 2008  citation needed  Audi TT sports car manufactured by Audi in Gy r  Because of the large austerity program  the real growth of the incomes was negative in 2007 at  5 5   and the estimates say 1  increase in 2008  The GDP growth was only 1 4  in 2007  much lower than in 2006 because of the decreased government spending  in first quarter of 2008 the GDP growth was 1 7   slightly stronger than last quarter of 2007  0 9    During the second quarter in 2008  the GDP growth was 2 0  annual  and because of the effects of the 2008 financial crisis on the Hungarian forint and on the bank system  the 3rd quarter growth was slowed to 0 8  annual  93  The estimates for 2009 are 1 1 5  decline  94  The 2008 financial crisis hit Hungary mainly in October 2008  When the Forint declined quickly against the euro  the Hungarian National Bank raised interest rates from 3 0  to 11 5  on 22 October  As the Hungarian Government asked financial rescue package worth  25 1 billion from the International Monetary Fund  the European Union  and the World Bank  promising to IMF that recalculate the 2009 budget  as Hungary s GDP declines 1 0   and slow down government spending  for example  stop the wage increase for state workers  95  This way  the budget gap decline to 2 6  down from 5 5  of GDP in 2007 and will meet Maastricht criteria  In this circumstances  more and more economists estimate  that Hungary can join the ERM II  which gives

Hungary include Historicism and Art Nouveau  or rather several variants of Art Nouveau  In contrast to Historicism  Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics  Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account   d n Lechner  1845 1914   the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau  was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture  and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs  In this way  he created an original synthesis of architectural styles  By applying them to three dimensional architectural elements  he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary  Museum of Applied Art  This Art Nouveau building was built to the plans of  d n Lechner  Turning away from the style of Lechner  yet taking inspiration from his approach  the group of  Young People   Fiatalok   which included K roly K s and Dezs  Zrumeczky  were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end  Besides the two principal styles  Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries  The Sezession from Vienna  the German Jugendstil  Art Nouveau from Belgium and France  and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century  B la Lajta initially adopted Lechner s style  subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends  after developing an interest in the Egyptian style  he finally arrived at modern architecture  Alad r  rkay took almost the same route  Istv n Medgyaszay developed his own style  which differed from Lechner s  using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete  In the sphere of applied arts  those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts  which opened in 1896  Foreigners are often surprised  but a great portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings  In Budapest downtown area almost all the buildings are about hundred years old  with thick walls  high ceiling and motifs on the front wall

greatest Hungarian composers  B la Bart k was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century  His music was invigorated by the themes  modes  and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and

founders of ethnomusicology Broughton claims that Hungary s  infectious sound has been surprisingly influential on neighboring countries  thanks perhaps to the common Austro Hungarian history  and it s not uncommon to hear Hungarian sounding tunes in Romania  Slovakia and southern Poland   119  It is also strong in the Szabolcs Szatm r area and in the southwest part of Transdanubia  near the border with Croatia  The Bus j r s carnival in Moh cs is a major Hungarian folk music event  formerly featuring the long established and well regarded Bogyiszl  orchestra  120  Hungarian classical music has long been an  experiment  made from Hungarian antedecents and on Hungarian soil  to create a conscious musical culture  using the  musical world of the folk song   121  Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe  leading to an influx of European musical ideas  the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to  re create a Hungarian classical style  122  For example  B la Bart k and Zolt n Kod ly  two of Hungary s best known composers  used folk themes in their music  Bart k collected folk songs from across Eastern Europe  including Romania and Slovakia  whilst Kod ly was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style  During the era of Communist rule in Hungary  1944 1989  a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity  Since then  however  the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover  producing successful performers in the fields of jazz such as trumpeter Rudolf Tomsits  pianist composer K roly Binder and  in a modernized form of Hungarian folk  Ferenc Seb  and M rta Sebesty n  The three giants of Hungarian rock  Ill s  Metr  and Omega  remain very popular  especially Omega  which has followings in Germany

Hungarian Academy of Sciences P O Box 67  H 1525 Budapest  The first successful spectral equation of black body radiation was the theory of continuous spectra of celestial bodies by Rad  von K vesligethy  published 1885 in Hungarian  1890 in German   K vesligethy made several assumptions on the matter radiation interaction  Based on these assumptions  he derived a spectral equation with the following properties  the spectral distribution of radiation depends only on the temperature  the total irradiated energy is finite  15 years before Planck    the wavelength of the intensity maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature  eight years before Wien    Using his spectral equation  he estimated the temperature of several celestial bodies  including the Sun  As a byproduct he developed a theory of the spectroscopic instruments   The Contribution of Hungarians to Universal Culture dead link   includes inventors   Embassy of the Republic of Hungary  Damascus  Syria  2006
