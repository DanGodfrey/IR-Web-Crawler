debut of John Glen  who had worked as editor and second unit director in three other Bond films  The screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G  Wilson takes its characters and combines the plots from two short stories from Ian Fleming s For Your Eyes Only collection  the title story and  Risico   In the plot  Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock  a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents  Some writing elements were inspired by the novels Live and Let Die  Goldfinger and On Her Majesty s Secret Service  After the over the top  science fiction focused Moonraker  the producers wanted a conscious return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming  For Your Eyes Only followed a more gritty  realistic approach  and an unusually strong narrative theme of revenge and its consequences  Filming locations included Greece  Italy and England  with underwater footage being shot in The Bahamas  For Your Eyes Only was released on 24 June 1981 to a mixed critical reception  the film was a financial success  generating  195 3 million worldwide  For Your Eyes Only was the last Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists  the studio merged with MGM soon after this movie s release  Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Production

scene  John Hollis as the  bald villain in wheelchair   12  voiced by Peter Marrinker  13  The character appears in the pre credits sequence and is both unnamed and uncredited  The character contains a number of characteristics of Ernst Stavro Blofeld  12  but could not be identified as such because of the legal reasons surrounding the Thunderball controversy with Kevin McClory claiming sole rights to the Blofeld character   a claim disputed by Eon  14  Bob Simmons  who previously portrayed Bond in the gun barrel sequences in the first three films and SPECTRE agent Colonel Jacques Bouvar in Thunderball  cameos as another villain as Gonzales  henchman who falls victim to Bond s exploding Lotus  10   edit  Production   We had gone as far as we could into space  We needed a change of some sort  back to the grass roots of Bond  We wanted to make the new film more of a thriller than a romp  without losing sight of what made Bond famous   its humour     John Glen 15  For Your Eyes Only marked a change in the make up of the production crew  John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director  a position he would occupy throughout the 1980s  16  The transition in directors resulted in a harder edged directorial style  with less emphasis on gadgetry and large action sequences in huge arenas  as was favoured by Lewis Gilbert   17  Emphasis was placed on tension  plot and character in addition to a return to Bond s more serious roots  18  whilst For Your Eyes Only  showed a clear attempt to activate some lapsed and inactive parts of the Bond mythology   19  The film was also a deliberate effort to bring the series more back to reality  following the huge success of Moonraker in 1979  20  As co writer Michael G  Wilson pointed out   If we went through the path of Moonraker things would just get more outlandish  so we needed to get back to basics   16  To that end  the story that emerged was simpler  not one in which the world was at risk  but returning the series to that of a Cold War thriller  16  Bond would also rely more on his wits than gadgets to survive  21  Glen decided to symbolically represent it with a scene where Bond s Lotus blows itself up and forces 007 to rely on Melina s more humble Citro n 2CV  16  Since Ken Adam was busy with Pennies from Heaven  Peter Lamont  who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger  was promoted to production designer  Following a suggestion of Glen  Lamont created realistic scenery  instead of the elaborate set pieces for which the series had been known  16   edit  Writing Richard Maibaum was once again the scriptwriter for the story  assisted by Michael G  Wilson  22  According to Wilson  the ideas from stories could have come from anyone as the outlines were worked out in committee that could include Broccoli  Maibaum  Wilson and stunt coordinators  23  Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Ian Fleming short stories from collection For Your Eyes Only  Risico and For Your Eyes Only  24  Another set piece from the novel of Live and Let Die   the keel hauling   which was unused in the film of the same name  was also inserted into the plot  23  Other ideas from Fleming were also used in For Your Eyes Only  such as the Identigraph  which come from the novel Goldfinger  where it was originally called the  Identicast   25  These elements from Fleming s stories were mixed with a cold war story centred on the MacGuffin of the ATAC  22  For Your Eyes Only is noted for its pre title sequence  described variously as either  out of place and disappointing  22  or  roaringly enjoyable   26  The scene was shot in order to introduce a potential new Bond to audiences  thus linking the new actor to elements from previous Bond films 23   see casting  below   The sequence begins with Bond laying flowers at the grave of his late wife  Tracy Bond  before a Universal Exports helicopter picks him up for an emergency  Control of the helicopter is taken over by remote control by a bald man in a grey Nehru jacket with a white cat  This character is un named in either the film or the credits  although he looks and sounds like Ernst Stavro Blofeld as played by Donald Pleasence or Telly Savalas  22  Director John Glen referred to the identity of the villain obliquely   We just let people use their imaginations and draw their own conclusions   It s a legal thing   1  The character is deliberately not named due to copyright restrictions with Kevin McClory  who owned the film rights to Thunderball  which supposedly includes the character Ernst Stavro Blofeld  the organisation SPECTRE  and other material associated with the development of Thunderball  27  Eon disputed McClory s ownership of the Blofeld character  but decided not to use him again  the scene was  a deliberate statement by Broccoli of his lack of need to use the character   14   edit  Casting Roger Moore s original contract with Eon Productions was for a three film deal to play Bond  this expired with The Spy Who Loved Me and Moore re negotiated his contract on a film by film basis thereafter  23  With the uncertainty surrounding his involvement in For Your Eyes Only  other actors were also considered  including Lewis Collins  known in the UK for his portrayal of Bodie in The Professionals  28 Michael Billington  who previously appeared in The Spy Who Loved Me as Agent XXX s ill fated lover   Billington s screen test for For Your Eyes Only was one of the five occasions he auditioned for the role of Bond  29  and Michael Jayston  who had appeared as the eponymous spy in the British TV series of Quiller 23   Jayston eventually played Bond in a BBC Radio production of You Only Live Twice in 1985   23  Eventually  however  this came to nothing  as Moore signed on to play Bond once again  Bernard Lee died in January 1981  after filming had started on For Your Eyes Only  but before he could film his scenes as M  the head of MI6  as he had done in the previous eleven films of the James Bond series  Out of respect  no new actor was hired to assume the role and  instead  the script was re written so that the character is said to be on leave  letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner takes over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence  30 Chaim Topol was cast following a suggestion by Broccoli s wife Dana  while Julian Glover joined the cast as the producers felt he was stylish   Glover was even considered to play Bond at some point  but Michael G  Wilson stated that  when we first thought of him he was too young  and by the time of For Your Eyes Only he was too old  16 Carole Bouquet was a suggestion of United Artists publicist Jerry Juroe  and after Glen and Broccoli saw her in That Obscure Object of Desire  they went to Rome to invite Bouquet for the role of Melina  31   edit  Filming A Citro n 2CV 007  similar to the one used in the film  Production of For Your Eyes Only begun on 2 September 1980 in the North Sea  with three days shooting exterior scenes with the St Georges  16  32  The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios  as well as the ship s explosion  which was done with a miniature in Pinewood s tank on the 007 Stage  33  On 15 September principal photography started in Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni  above Corfu Town  20  which acted as the location of the Spanish villa  Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons  34  Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina s Citro n 2CV and Gonzales  men driving Peugeot 504s  31  The scene was shot across twelve days  with stunt driver R my Julienne   who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye   driving the Citro n  35  Four 2CVs were used  with modifications for the stunts   all had more powerful flat four engines  and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so it could get turned upside down  36  37  38  In October filming moved to other Greek locations  including Meteora and the Achilleion  39  In November  the main unit moved to England  which included interior work in Pinewood  while the second unit shot underwater scenes in The Bahamas  On 1 January 1981  production moved to Cortina D Ampezzo in Italy  where filming wrapped on February  16  Since it was not snowing in Cortina D Ampezzo by the time of filming  the producers had to pay for trucks to bring snow from nearby mountains  which was then dumped in the city s streets  40  Many of the underwater scenes  especially involving close ups of Bond and Melina  were actually faked on a dry soundstage  A combination of lighting effects  slow motion photography  wind  and bubbles added in post production  gave the illusion of the actors being underwater  20  Actress Carole Bouquet reportedly had a pre existing health condition that prevented her from performing actual underwater stunt work  16  Actual aquatic scenes were done by a team lead by Al Giddings  who had previously worked in The Deep  and filmed in either Pinewood s tank on the 007 Stage or an underwater set built in the Bahamas  Production designer Peter Lamont and his team developed two working props for the submarine Neptune  as well as a mock up with a fake bottom  41  Roger Moore was reluctant to film the scene of Bond kicking a car  with Locque inside  over the edge of a cliff  saying that it  was Bond like  but not Roger Moore Bond like   16  Michael G  Wilson later said that Moore had to be persuaded to be more ruthless than he felt comfortable  1  Wilson also added that he and Richard Maibaum  along with John Glen  toyed with other ideas surrounding that scene  but ultimately everyone  even Moore  agreed to do the scene as originally written  16  The Monastery of the Holy Trinity in Meteora served as a location For the Meteora shoots  a Greek bishop was paid to allow filming in the monasteries  but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly critical of production rolling in their installations  After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court  it was decided that the monks  only property were the interiors   the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government  In protest  the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting  16  34  and tried to sabotage production as much as possible  hanging their washing out of their windows 10  and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots  and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters  The production team solved the problem with back lighting  matte paintings  and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock  and a monastery set in Pinewood  32  Roger Moore said he had a great fear of heights  and to do the climbing in Greece  he resorted to moderate drinking to calm his nerves  16  Later in that same sequence  Rick Sylvester  a stuntman who had previously performed the pre credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me  undertook the stunt of Bond falling off the side of the cliff  42  The stunt was dangerous  since the sudden stop at the bottom could be fatal  Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop  but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him   From where we were  shooting   you could see the local cemetery  and the box  to stop my fall  looked like a casket  You didn t need to be an English major to connect the dots   The stunt went off without a problem  16  Bond veteran cameraman and professional skiier Willy Bogner  Jr  was promoted to director of a second unit involving ski footage  40  Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty s Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me  16  To allow better filming  Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh  allowing to film the vehicle or behind it  42  and a set of skis that allowed him to ski forwards and backwards in order to get the best shots  20  In February 1981  on the final day of filming the bobsleigh chase  one of the stuntman driving a sleigh  23 year old Paolo Rigon  was killed when he became trapped under the bob  10  The pre credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery  while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London  39  The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick s 1987 film  Full Metal Jacket  43  Director John Glen got the idea for the remote controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car  16  Since flying the helicopter through a warehouse was too dangerous  the scene where the vehicle enters was done through forced perspective   stunt pilot Marc Wolff drove besides the building  making it seem as if the helicopter was entering a smaller mock up built by Derek Meddings  team which was closer to the camera   while the footage inside the building was shot on location  though with a life sized helicopter model which stood over a rail  Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter  while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model  31  44   edit  Music Main article  For Your Eyes Only  soundtrack  The score of For Your Eyes Only was written by Bill Conti  who retained a number of John Barry influnced brass elements in the score  but also added elements of dance and funk music  45  Whilst one reviewer observed that  Bill Conti s score is a constant source of annoyance   46  another claimed that  In the end  For Your Eyes Only stands as one of the best James Bond film scores of the 1980s   45  The title song  written by Conti and Michael Leeson  was sung by Sheena Easton  who holds the distinction of being the first title song artist to appear on screen in a Bond film  25  as designer Maurice Binder liked Easton s appearance and decided to add her to the opening credits  47  The producers of the film wanted Blondie to perform the title song  the band wrote a song titled  For Your Eyes Only   but decided to decline the offer when they discovered the producers wanted a recording of Conti s song instead  Blondie s song can be found on their 1982 album  The Hunter  48   edit  Release and reception For Your Eyes Only was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 24 June 1981  49  setting an all time opening day record for any film at any cinema in the UK with a gross of  14 998 50    42 850 in 2012 pounds 51      29 696   50  The film went on general release in the UK the same day  For Your Eyes Only had its North American premiere in the US and Canada on Friday  26 June  at approximately 1 100 cinemas  50  For Your Eyes Only watch  released as part of the merchandising for the film The film grossed  54 8 million in the United States  52   equivalent to  101 5 million at 2011 ticket prices 53  or  140 million in 2012 dollars  54  adjusted for general inflation  and  195 3 million worldwide  55  becoming the second highest grossing Bond film after its predecessor  Moonraker  52  This was the last James Bond film to be solely released by United Artists  Following the MGM and United Artists merger  the films were released by  MGM UA Distribution Co   56  The promotional cinema poster for the film featured a woman holding a crossbow  she was photographed from behind  and her outfit left the bottom half of her buttocks exposed  The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards  so that the part seen on her backside is actually the front of the suit  57  The poster caused some furore largely in the US with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee  58  whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs  59  There was significant speculation as to identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified the model to be Joyce Bartle  58  There were a number of items of merchandising issued to coincide with the film  including a 007 digital watch and Corgi Toys produced a copy of Melina s Citro n 2CV  57 Citro n itself did a special  007  edition of the 2CV  which even had decorative bullet holes on the door  60 Marvel Comics also did a comic book adaptation  see section below   57   edit  Contemporary reviews Derek Malcolm in The Guardian was scathing of the film  saying it was  too long   and pretty boring between the stunts   although he admitted that the stunts were of a high quality  61  According to Malcolm  Bond  inhabits a fantasy land of more or less bloodless violence  groinless sex and naivity masked as superior sophistication   with Moore playing him as if in a  nicely lubricated daze   61  Although Malcolm tipped the film for international box office success  he observed that he  can t quite see why the series has lasted so long and so strong in people s affections   61  Writing in The Observer  Philip French commented that  not for the first time the pre credits sequence is the best thing about the film   62  French was dismissive of Moore s Bond  saying that Bond was  impersonated by Moore  and referred to Moore s advancing years  62  Ian Christie  writing in the Daily Express  said that it was not  much of a plot  but it has a touch of credibility which is a welcome change from some of its predecessors   63  Overall  Christie thought  For Your Eyes Only was  one of the better Bonds  with a nice balance between humour and excitement and the usual bevy of beautiful girls   63  Christie s colleague in the Sunday Express  Richard Barkley was praising of the film  saying that For Your Eyes Only  is one of the most exciting yet   Barkley describes Moore s Bond as having an  accustomed debonair calm and quiet authority   All told  Barkley thought  this Bond movie is smashing entertainment   64  David Robinson  writing in The Times bemoaned the fact that the  dramatic bits between the set pieces don t count for much   Like other critics at the time his praise was more directed towards the stunt crews  they were  better than ever in this one   65  The film critic for the magazine Time Out was brief and pithy   no plot and poor dialogue  and Moore really is old enough to be the uncle of those girls   66  For the US press  Gary Arnold in The Washington Post thought the film was  undeniably easy on the eyes   and further added  maybe too easy to prevent the mind from wandering and the lids from drooping   67  Arnold was also critical of the large set pieces  calling them  more ponderous than sensational  and that there was  no equivalent of the classic action highlights that can be recalled readily from  From Russia  With Love  or  You Only Live Twice  or  The Spy Who Loved Me  or  Moonraker   This is a Bond waiting for something inspired to push it over the top   67 The New York Times critic Vincent Canby said that  For Your Eyes Only is not the best of the series by a long shot  although he does say that the film is  slick entertainment  with a tone that is  consistently comic even when the material is not   68  Jack Kroll in Newsweek was dismissive of the film  saying it was  an anthology of action episodes held together by the thinnest of plot lines   although he does concede that these set pieces are  terrific in their exhilaratingly absurd energy   69  For Time magazine  Richard Corliss concentrated on the stunts  saying the team  have devised some splendid optional features for For Your Eyes Only  whilst also commenting on Roger Moore  saying that his  mannequin good looks and waxed fruit insouciance  show him to be  the best oiled cog in this perpetual motion machine   70   edit  Reflective reviews Opinion on For Your Eyes Only has not changed with the passing of time and the reviews are still mixed  as of August 2011  the film holds a 69   fresh  rating from Rotten Tomatoes  71  being ranked twelfth among the 22 Bond films  72  Ian Nathan of Empire gives the film only two of a possible five stars  observing that the film  still ranks as one of the most forgettable Bonds on record   73  In 2006  IGN chose For Your Eyes Only as the sixth best Bond film  claiming it is  a good old fashioned espionage tale   74  a placement shared by Norman Wilner of MSN  who considered it  the one Moore film that seems to reach back to Connery s heyday   75  and Entertainment Weekly chose it as the tenth best in 2008  saying it was a  return to low tech  low key Bond  with     some of the best stunts since the early days   76  In October 2008 Time Out re issued a review of For Your Eyes Only and observed that the film is  admirable in intent  but that it  feels a little spare   largely because the plot has been  divested of the bells and whistles that hallmark the franchise   46  Some critics saw the film as being  a solid adventure  although it could have been better   77  whilst Danny Peary thought  There are exciting moments  but most of it is standard Bond fare   going on to describe For Your Eyes Only as  an attempt to mix spectacle with  the  tough  believable storylines of early Bond films     it  is enjoyable while you re watching it  Afterward  it s one of the most forgettable of the Bond series   78 Raymond Benson  the author of nine Bond novels  thought For Your Eyes Only was Roger Moore s best Bond film  79  Although Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly ranks Carole Bouquet playing Melina as the worst babe of the seven Roger Moore James Bond films  80  his colleague  Joshua Rich disagreed  putting her tenth in the overall 10 Best Bond Girls listing from the 21 films released up to that point  81 Entertainment Weekly also ranked Lynn Holly Johnson as Bibi Dahl as ninth on their list of the 10 worst Bond girls from the choice of from the 21 films that had been released  82  After twenty films had been released  IGN ranked Bouquet as fifth in their  top 10 Bond Babes  list  83  and The Times thought she was sixth on their list of the Top 10 most fashionable Bond girls after 21 films had been released  84   edit  Accolades The song  For Your Eyes Only  was nominated for a Best Original Song at the 39th Golden Globe Awards 85  and Best Original Song at the 1981 Academy Awards  losing out at both ceremonies to  Arthur s Theme  from the film Arthur  86  However  the 1981 Academy Award s ceremony did see Albert R Broccoli awarded
