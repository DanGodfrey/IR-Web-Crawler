founding Warner brothers  born Wonskolaser  pron  WON Sko La  Ser  or Wonsal  2  3  Harry  born Hirsz   Albert  born Aaron   Sam  born Szmul   and Jack  Itzhak or to some sources Jacob   whose Jewish parents had emigrated to North America from the part of Poland that had been subjugated to the Russian Empire following the 18th century partitions of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  The three elder brothers began in the movie theatre business  having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of Pennsylvania and Ohio  They opened their first theater  the Cascade  in New Castle  Pennsylvania in 1903   The site of the Cascade later became the Cascade Center  a shopping  dining and entertainment complex honoring its Warner Bros  heritage  though in late 2010 all of the businesses have closed and the complex is currently for sale   4  When this original theatre building in New Castle was in danger of being demolished  the modern Warner Bros  called the modern building owners  and arranged a 3 way even splitting of the cost of saving it  between the state  Warner Bros  and the modern owners  The owners noted the fact that they were taking phone calls from all over the country in reference to the historical significance of the humble building that should be saved historically  5  In 1904  the Warners founded the Pittsburgh based Duquesne Amusement  amp  Supply Company  4  to distribute films  Within a few years this led to the distribution of pictures across a four state area  In 1912  Harry Warner hired an auditor named Paul Ashley Chase  By the time of World War I they had begun producing films  and in 1918 the brothers opened the Warner Bros  studio on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood  Sam and Jack Warner produced the pictures  while Harry and Albert Warner and their auditor and now controller Chase handled finance and distribution in New York City  It was during World War I and their first nationally syndicated film was My Four Years in Germany based on a popular book by former American Ambassador James W  Gerard  On April 4  1923  with help from a loan given to Harry Warner by his banker Motley Flint  6  they formally incorporated as Warner Brothers Pictures  Incorporated  However  as late as the 1960s  Warner Bros  claimed 1905 as its founding date  7  The first important deal for the company was the acquisition of the rights to Avery Hopwood s 1919 Broadway play  The Gold Diggers  from theatrical impresario David Belasco  However  what really put Warner Bros  on the Hollywood map was a dog  Rin Tin Tin  8  brought from France after World War I by an American soldier  9  Rin Tin Tin debuted in the feature Where the North Begins  The movie was so successful that Jack Warner agreed to sign the dog to star in more films for  1 000 per week  8  Rin Tin Tin became the top star at the studio  8  Jack Warner nicknamed him  The Mortgage Lifter  8  and the success boosted Darryl F  Zanuck s career  10  Zanuck eventually became a top producer for the studio 11  and between 1928 and 1933 served as Jack Warner s right hand man and executive producer  with responsibilities including the day to day production of films  12  More success came after Ernst Lubitsch was hired as head director  10 Harry Rapf left the studio and accepted an offer to work at MGM  13  Lubitsch s film The Marriage Circle was the studio s most successful film of 1924  and was on The New York Times best list for the year  10  Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and Lubitsch  Warners was still unable to achieve star power  14  As a result  Sam and Jack decided to offer Broadway actor John Barrymore the lead role in Beau Brummel  14  The film was so successful that Harry Warner agreed to sign Barrymore to a generous long term contract  15  like The Marriage Circle  Beau Brummell was named one of the ten best films of the year by The New York Times  15  By the end of 1924  Warner Bros  was arguably the most successful independent studio in Hollywood  15  but it still competed with  The Big Three  Studios  First National  Paramount Pictures  and MGM   16  As a result  Harry Warner   while speaking at a convention of 1 500 independent exhibitors in Milwaukee  Wisconsin   was able to convince the filmmakers to spend  500 000 in newspaper advertising  17  and Harry saw this as an opportunity to finally be able to establish theaters in big cities like New York and Los Angeles  17  As the studio prospered  it gained backing from Wall Street  and in 1924 Goldman Sachs arranged a major loan  With this new money  the Warners bought the pioneer Vitagraph Company which had a nation wide distribution system  17  In 1925  Warners also experimented in radio  establishing a successful radio station  KFWB  in Los Angeles  18   edit  1925 35  Sound  Color  Style Warner Bros  was a pioneer of films with synchronized sound  then known as  talking pictures  or  talkies    In 1925  at the urging of Sam  the Warners agreed to expand their operations by adding this feature to their productions  19  Harry  however  opposed it  20  famously wondering   Who the heck wants to hear actors talk   By February 1926  the studio suffered a reported net loss of  333 413  21  Don Juan opens Warners  Theater After a long period of denying Sam s request for sound  Harry now agreed to accept Sam s demands  as long as the studio s use of synchronized sound was for background music purposes only  19  The Warners then signed a contract with the sound engineer company Western Electric and established Vitaphone  22  In 1926  Vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks  most notably  in the feature Don Juan starring John Barrymore  The film was silent  but it featured a large number of Vitaphone shorts at the beginning  To hype Don Juan s release  Harry Warner also acquired the large Piccadilly Theater in Manhattan  New York and renamed it the Warner Theater  23  Don Juan premiered at the Warner Theater in New York on August 6  1926  23  Throughout the early history of film distribution  theater owners hired orchestras to attend film showings and provide soundtracks  Through Vitaphone  however  Warner Bros  produced eight Vitaphone shorts  which aired at the beginning of every showing of Don Juan across the country  in 1926  and got many film production companies to question the necessity  24  While Don Juan was a success at the box office  25  it did not earn back its production cost 25  and Lubsitch left Warner for MGM  14  By April 1927  the Big Five studios  First National  Paramount  MGM  Universal  and Producers Distributing  had put the Warner brothers in financial ruin  26  and Western Electric renewed Warner s Vitaphone contract with terms that allowed other film companies to test sound  26  As a result of the financial problems the studio was having  Warner Bros  took the next step and released The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson  This movie  which has very little sound dialog but does feature sound segments of Jolson singing  was a sensation  It signaled the beginning of the era of  talking pictures  and the twilight of the silent era  However  as Sam died  the brothers were at his funeral and could not attend the premiere  Jack became sole head of production  27  Sam s death also had a great effect on Jack s emotional state  28  as Sam was arguably Jack s inspiration and favorite brother  29  In the years to come  Jack ran the studio with an iron fist  28  Firing of studio employees soon became his trademark  30  Among those whom Jack fired were Rin Tin Tin  in 1929  and Douglas Fairbanks  Jr    who had served as First National s top star since the brothers acquired the studio in 1928 in 1933  30  Thanks to the success of The Jazz Singer  the studio was suddenly flush with cash  Jolson s next film for the company  The Singing Fool was also a success  31  With the success of these first talkies  The Jazz Singer  Lights of New York  The Singing Fool  and The Terror   Warner Bros  became one of the top studios in Hollywood and the brothers were now able to move out from the Poverty Row section of Hollywood and acquire a big studio in Burbank  California  32  They were also able to expand studio operations by acquiring the Stanley Corporation  a major theater chain  33  This gave them a share in rival First National Pictures  of which Stanley owned one third  34  In a bidding war with William Fox  Warner Bros  bought more First National shares on September 13  1928  35  35  Jack Warner also appointed producer Darryl Zanuck as the studio s manager of First National Pictures  35  In 1929  Warner Bros also bought the St  Louis based theater chain Skouras Brothers  Following this take over  Spyros Skouras  the driving force of the chain  became general manager of the Warner Brothers Theater Circuit in America  He worked successfully in that post for two years and managed to eliminate the losses and eventually even increase the profits  This was a welcome gain given the financial hardships occasioned by the Great Depression  In addition  Harry Warner was also able to acquire a string of music publishers and form Warner Bros  Music  In April 1930  the Warner Bros  acquired Brunswick Records  Harry also obtained a string of radio companies  foreign sound patents  and even a lithograph company  35  After establishing Warner Bros  Music  Harry appointed his son  Lewis  to serve as the company s head manager  36  In 1929  Harry was also able to produce an adaptation of a Cole Porter musical titled Fifty Million Frenchmen  37  Through First National  the studio s profit increased substantially  38  After the success of the studio s 1929 First National film Noah s Ark  Harry also agreed to make Michael Curtiz a major director at the Burbank studio  39  Mort Blumenstock  a First National screenwriter  became a top writer at the brothers  New York headquarters  40  In the third quarter of 1929  Warner Bros  gained complete control of First National  when Harry purchased the company s remaining one third share from Fox  35  The Justice Department agreed to allow the purchase if First National was maintained as a separate company  41  When the Great Depression hit  Warner asked for and got permission to merge the two studios  soon afterward Warner Bros  moved to the First National lot in Burbank  Though the companies merged  the Justice Department required Warner to produce and release a few films each year under the First National name until 1938  For 30 years  certain Warner productions were identified  mainly for tax purposes  as  A Warner Bros    First National Picture   In the latter part of 1929  Jack Warner hired sixty one year old actor George Arliss to star in Disraeli  42  which was a surprise success  42  Arliss won an Academy Award for Best Actor and went on to star in nine more movies with the studio  42  In 1930  Harry acquired more theaters in Atlantic City  despite the beginning of the Great Depression  43  In July 1930  the studio s banker  Motley Flint  was murdered by a disgruntled investor in another company  44  By 1931  however  the studio began to feel the effects of the Depression as the general public became unable to afford the price of a movie ticket  45  In 1931  the studio reportedly suffered a net loss of  8 million  45  and an additional  14 million the following year  45  In 1931  Warner Bros  Music head Lewis Warner died from an infected wisdom tooth  44  Around that time  Warner Bros  head producer Darryl Zanuck hired screenwriter Wilson Mizner  46  While at the studio  Mizner had hardly any respect for authority and found it difficult to work with studio boss Jack Warner  46  but nevertheless became a valuable asset  46  As time went by  Warner became more tolerant of Mizner and helped invest in Mizner s Brown Derby restaurant  46  On April 3  1933  Mizner died from a heart attack  47  In 1928  Warner Bros  released Lights of New York  the first all talking feature  Due to its success  the movie industry converted entirely to sound almost overnight  By the end of 1929  all the major studios were exclusively making sound films  In 1929  National Pictures released their first film with Warner Bros   Noah s Ark  48  Despite its expensive budget  Noah s Ark was profitable  49  In 1929  Warner Bros  released On with the Show  the first all color all talking feature  This was followed by Gold Diggers of Broadway which was so popular it played in theatres until 1939  The success of these two color pictures caused a color revolution  just as the first all talkie had created one for talkies   Warner Bros  released a large number of color films from 1929 to 1931  including The Show of Shows  1929   Sally  1929   Bright Lights  1930   Golden Dawn  1930   Hold Everything  1930   Song of the Flame  1930   Song of the West  1930   The Life of the Party  1930   Sweet Kitty Bellairs  1930   Under A Texas Moon  1930   Bride of the Regiment  1930   Viennese Nights  1931   Woman Hungry  1931   Kiss Me Again  1931   Fifty Million Frenchmen  1931   and Manhattan Parade  1932   In addition to these  scores of features were released with Technicolor sequences as well as a numerous variety of short subjects  The majority of these color films were musicals  Three years later  the audience had grown so tired of musicals  the studio was forced to cut the musical numbers of many of the productions and advertise them as straight comedies  The public had begun to associate musicals with color and thus the movie studios began to abandon its use  Warner Bros  had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process  As a result  the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio  Doctor X  1932  and Mystery of the Wax Museum  1933   In the latter part of 1931  Harry Warner rented the Teddington Studios in London  England  50  The studio focused on making  quota quickies  for the domestic British market 51  and Irving Asher was appointed as the studio s head producer  51  In 1934  Harry Warner officially purchased the Teddington Studios  50  In February 1933  however  Warner Bros  produced 42nd Street  a very successful musical 52  that saved the company from bankruptcy  53  In the wake of 42nd Street s success  the studio produced further profitable musicals  54  These starred Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell and were mostly directed by Busby Berkeley  55  In 1935  the revival suffered a major blow when Berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk  56  By the end of the year  people again tired of Warner Bros  musicals  54  and the studio   after the huge profits made by the 1935 film Captain Blood   shifted its focus on producing Errol Flynn swashbucklers  57   edit  1931 1935  Pre code realistic period The studio as seen in the trailer for The Petrified Forest  1936  With the collapse of the market for musicals  Warner Bros   under production head Darryl F  Zanuck  turned to more socially realistic storylines   torn from the headlines  pictures many in the media said glorified gangsters  58  Warner Bros  soon became known as a  gangster studio   59  The studio s first gangster film  Little Caesar  was a great box office success 60  and Edward G  Robinson was a star in many of the subsequent wave of Warner gangster films  61  The studio s next gangster film  The Public Enemy  62  made James Cagney arguably the studio s new top star  63  and Warner Bros  was now convinced to make more gangster films  62  Another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang  based on a true story and starring Paul Muni  64  In addition to Cagney and Robinson  Muni was also given a big push as one the studio s top gangster stars 65  after appearing in the successful film  62  which got audiences to question the legal system in the United States  66  By January 1933  the film s protagonist Robert Elliot Burns   who was still imprisoned in New Jersey   and a number of different chain gang prisoners nationwide in the United States were able to appeal and were released  67  In January 1933  Georgia chain gang warden J  Harold Hardy   who was also made into a character in the film   sued the studio for displaying  vicious  untrue and false attacks  against him in the film  68  After appearing in the film The Man Who Played God  Bette Davis became a top star for the studio  69  In 1933  relief for the studio came after Franklin D  Roosevelt became president and was able to stimulate the economy with the New Deal  70  because of this economic rebound  Warner Bros  again became profitable  70  The same year  long time head producer Darryl F  Zanuck quit  One reason was Harry Warner s relationship with Zanuck had become strained after Harry strongly opposed allowing Zanuck s film Baby Face to step outside Hays Code boundaries  71  Also  the studio reduced Zanuck s salary as a result of the losses as a result of the Great Depression  72  and Harry continued to refuse to restore it in the wake of the New Deal s rebound  73  Zanuck resigned 74  and established his own company  73  In the wake of Zanuck s resignation  Harry Warner agreed to again raise the salary for studio employees  73  In 1933  Warner was able to bring newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst s Cosmopolitan films into the Warner Bros  fold  75  Hearst had previously been signed with MGM  76  but ended the association after a dispute with the company s head producer Irving Thalberg over the treatment of Hearst s long standing mistress  actress Marion Davies  77  who was struggling for box office success  77  Through his partnership with Hearst  Warner was able to sign Davies to a studio contract  75  Hearst s company and Davies  films  however  could not increase the studio s profits  76  In 1934  the studio lost over  2 5 million  78  of which  500 000 was the result of a fire at the Burbank studio at the end of 1934  destroying 20 years worth of early Vitagraph  Warner Bros   and First National films  78  The following year  Hearst s film adaption of William Shakespeare s A Midsummer Night s Dream  1935  failed at the box office and the studio s net loss increased  79  During this time  Warner Bros  President Harry Warner and six other movie studio figures were indicted of conspiracy to violate the Sherman Antitrust Act  78  through an attempt to gain a monopoly over theaters in the St Louis area  80  In 1935  Harry was put on trial  78  after a mistrial  Harry sold the company s movie theaters  at least for a short time  and the case was never reopened  81  1935 also saw the studio rebound with a net profit of  674 158 00  81  By 1936  contracts of musical and silent stars were not renewed and new talent  tough talking  working class types  were hired who more suitably fit in with these sort of pictures  Stars such as Dorothy Mackaill  Bebe Daniels  Frank Fay  Winnie Lightner  Bernice Claire  Alexander Gray  Alice White  and Jack Mulhall that had characterized the urban  modern  and sophisticated attitude of the 1920s gave way to stars such James Cagney  Joan Blondell  Edward G  Robinson  Warren William  and Barbara Stanwyck who would be more acceptable to the common man  The studio was one of the most prolific producers of Pre Code pictures and had a lot of trouble with the censors once they started clamping down on what they considered indecency  around 1934   82  As a result  Warner Bros  turned out a number of historical pictures from around 1935 in order to avoid confrontations with the Breen office  In 1936  following the success of The Petrified Forest  Jack Warner also signed Humphrey Bogart to a studio contract  83  Warner  however  did not think Bogart was star material  84  and decided to only cast Bogart in infrequent roles as a villain opposite either James Cagney or Edward Robinson over the next five years  83  After Hal B  Wallis succeeded Zanuck in 1933 85  and the Hays Code began to be enforced in 1935  the studio was forced to abandon this realistic approach in order to produce more moralistic  idealized pictures  The studio naturally turned to historical dramas which would not cause any problems with the censors  Other offerings included melodramas  or  women s pictures    swashbucklers  and adaptations of best sellers  with stars like Bette Davis  Olivia de Havilland  Paul Muni  and Errol Flynn  In 1936  Bette Davis  by now arguably the studio s top star  86  was unhappy with the roles Warner was giving her  She fled to England and tried to break her contract with Warner Bros  86  Davis lost the lawsuit and soon returned to America  87  Although many of the studio s employees had problems with Jack Warner  they considered Albert and Harry fair  88   edit  Code era This period also saw the disappearance of a large number of actors and actresses who had characterized the realistic pre Code era but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures  Warner Bros  remained a top studio in Hollywood since the dawn of talkies  but this changed after 1935 as other studios  notably MGM  quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized Warner Bros  However  in the late 1930s  Bette Davis became the studio s top draw and was even dubbed as  The Fifth Warner Brother   89  In 1935  Cagney sued Jack Warner for breach of contract  90  Cagney claimed Warner had forced him to star in more films than his contract required  90  Cagney eventually dropped his lawsuit after a cash settlement  91  Nevertheless  Cagney left the studio to establish an independent film company with his brother Bill  92  The Cagneys released their films though Grand National Films  however they were not able to get good financing for their productions 92  and ran out of money after their third film  92  Cagney then agreed to return to Warner Bros   after Jack Warner agreed to a contract guaranteeing Cagney would be treated to his own terms  92  After the success of Yankee Doodle Dandy at the box office  Cagney again questioned if the studio would meet his salary demand 93  and again quit to form his own film production and distribution company with his brother Bill  94  Another employee with whom Warner had troubles was studio producer Bryan Foy  95  In 1936  Wallis hired Foy as a producer for the studio s low budget B films leading to his nickname  the keeper of the B s   88  Foy was able to garnish arguably more profits than any other B film producer at the time  88  During Foy s time at the studio  however  Warner fired him seven different times  95  During 1936  the studio s film The Story of Louis Pasteur proved a box office success 96  and Paul Muni  the film s star  won the Oscar for Best Actor in March 1937  96  The studio s 1937 film The Life of Emile Zola gave the studio its first Best Picture Oscar  96  In 1937  the studio hired Midwestern radio announcer Ronald Reagan  97  Although Reagan was initially a small time B film actor  97  Warner Bros  was impressed by his performance in the final scene of Knute Rockne  All American  97  and agreed to pair him with Errol Flynn in their film Santa Fe Trail  1940   Reagan then returned to B films  97  After his performance in the studio s 1942 Kings Row  Warner decided to make Reagan a top star and signed him to a new contract  tripling his salary  98  In 1936  Harry Warner s daughter Doris read a copy of Margaret Mitchell s Gone with the Wind and was interested in making a film adaptation  99  Doris then offered Mitchell  50 000 for the book s screen rights  99  Jack  however  refused to allow the deal to take place  realizing it would be an expensive production  99  Another studio actor who proved to be a problem for Jack Warner was George Raft  100  Warner had signed Raft in 1939  hoping he could substitute in gangster pictures when either Robinson or Cagney were on suspension  100  Raft had difficulty working with Bogart and refused to co star in any film with him  101  Eventually  Jack Warner agreed to release Raft from his contract  102  Following Raft s departure  the studio gave Bogart the role of Roy Earl in the 1941 film High Sierra  102  which helped establish him as one of the studio s top stars  103  following High Sierra  Bogart was also given a role in John Huston s successful 1941 remake of the studio s 1931 failure  The Maltese Falcon  104   edit  1930  Birth of Warner s cartoons Bugs Bunny  Daffy Duck  and Porky Pig are three of the animated cartoon characters that have become central to the corporate image of Warner Bros  Warner s cartoon unit had its roots in the independent Harman and Ising studio  From 1930 to 1933  Disney alumni Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising produced a series of musical cartoons for Leon Schlesinger  who sold the shorts to Warner  Harman and Ising introduced their character Bosko in the first Looney Tunes cartoon  Sinkin  in the Bathtub  and created a sister series  Merrie Melodies  in 1931  105  Harman and Ising broke away from Schlesinger in 1933 due to a contractual dispute  taking Bosko with them to MGM  As a result  Schlesinger started his own studio  Leon Schlesinger Productions  which continued with Merrie Melodies while starting production on Looney Tunes starring Buddy  a Bosko clone  By the end of the decade  a new Schlesinger production team  including directors Friz Freleng  Tex Avery  Robert Clampett  and Chuck Jones was formed  Schlesinger s staff developed a fast paced  irreverent style that made their cartoons immensely popular worldwide  In 1936  Avery directed a string of cartoons  starring Porky Pig  which established the character as the studio s first bona fide star  106  In addition to Porky Pig  Warner Bros  cartoon characters Daffy Duck  who debuted in the 1937 short Porky s Duck Hunt  and Bugs Bunny  who debuted in the 1940 short A Wild Hare  also achieved star power  107  By 1942  the Schlesinger studio had surpassed Walt Disney Studios as the most successful producer of animated shorts in the United States  108  Warner Bros eventually bought Schlesinger s cartoon unit in 1944 as a division  renamed it as Warner Bros  Cartoons  Unfortunately  the unit was indifferently treated by senior management  beginning with the installation of Edward Selzer as senior producer  whom the creative staff considered an interfering incompetent  Furthermore  Jack Warner  who had little regard for his company s short film product  reputedly was so ignorant of his animation division that he was mistakenly convinced that the unit produced cartoons of Mickey Mouse  rival company Walt Disney Pictures  flagship character  109  Furthermore  he sold off the unit s pre 1948 library for a mere  3000 each  which proved a short sighted transaction in light of the considerable long term value that the company s animation product proved to have  110  Warner Brothers Cartoons continued  with intermittent interruptions  until 1969 when it was dissolved when the parent company ceased film short production entirely  Regardless of this treatment  its characters such as Bugs Bunny  Daffy Duck  Tweety Bird  Sylvester  and Porky Pig became central to the company s image in subsequent decades  Bugs in particular remains a mascot to Warner Bros   various divisions and Six Flags  which Time Warner previously owned   In fact  it was the success of the compilation film  The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie in 1980  featuring the archived film of these characters that prompted Warner Brothers to organize Warner Brothers Animation as a new production division to restart production of original material   edit  World War II According to Jack Warner in his autobiography  prior to the United States entering World War II  the head of Warner Bros  sales in Germany  Philip Kauffman  was murdered by the Nazis in Berlin in 1936  111  112  113 Harry Warner produced the successful anti German film The Life of Emile Zola  1937   114  After that  Harry supervised the production of several more anti German films  including Confessions of a Nazi Spy  1939   115 The Sea Hawk  1940   which made King Phillip II an equivalent of Hitler  116 Sergeant York  116  and You re In The Army Now  1941   116  After the United States officially entered World War II  Harry Warner decided to focus on producing war films  117  Also  one fourth of the studio s employees  including Jack Warner and his son Jack Jr   were drafted or enlisted  117  Among the films the studio made during the war were Casablanca  Now  Voyager  Yankee Doodle Dandy  all 1942   This Is the Army  and Mission to Moscow  both 1943   118  the latter became controversial a few years afterwards  At the premieres of Yankee Doodle Dandy  in Los Angeles  New York  and London   audiences purchased  15 6 million in war bonds for the governments of England and the United States  118  By the middle of 1943  however  it became clear audiences were tired of war films  118  Despite the growing pressure to abandon production of war films  Warner continued to produce them  losing money in the process  118  Eventually  in honor of the studio s contributions to the war cause  the United States Government named a Liberty ship after the brothers  father  Benjamin Warner  and Harry Warner was given the honor of christening the ship  118  By the time the war ended   20 million in war bonds were purchased through the studio  118 the Red Cross collected 5 200 pints of plasma from studio employees  118  and 763 of the studio s employees served in the armed forces  including Harry Warner s son in law Milton Sperling and Jack s son Jack Warner Jr  Following a dispute over ownership of Casablanca s Oscar for Best Picture  head producer Hal B  Wallis broke with Warner and resigned  Thomas After Casablanca made Bogart one of the studio s top stars  94  Bogart found his relationship with Jack Warner deteriorating  94  In 1943  Olivia de Haviland  whom Warner was now loaning to different companies  sued Warner for breach of contract  119  Warners cut its film production in half during the war  eliminating its B Picture unit in 1941  Bryan Foy was quickly snapped up by 20th Century Fox  120  De Haviland had refused to accept an offer to portray famed abolitionist Elizabeth Blackwell in an upcoming film for Columbia Pictures  119  Warner responded by sending 150 telegrams to different film production companies  warning them not to hire her for any role  119  Afterwards  de Haviland discovered employment contracts in the United States could only serve a duration of seven years  de Haviland had been under contract with the studio since 1935  121  The court ruled in de Haviland s favor 119  and she left the studio  119  Through de Haviland s victory  many of the studio s longtime actors were now freed from their contracts  119  and Harry Warner decided to terminate the studio s suspension policy  122  The same year  Jack Warner also signed newly released MGM actress Joan Crawford  a former top star who found her career fading  123  Crawford s first role with the studio was 1944 s Hollywood Canteen  124  Her first starring role at the studio  in the title role as Mildred Pierce  1945   revived her career 124  and earned her an Oscar for Best Actress  125   edit  After World War II  changing hands The record attendance figures of the World War II years made the Warner brothers rich  The gritty Warner image of the 1930s gave way to a glossier look  especially in women s pictures starring Davis  de Havilland  and Crawford  The 1940s also saw the rise of Bogart  In the post war years  Warner Bros  continued to create new stars  like Lauren Bacall and Doris Day  The studio prospered greatly after the war  126  By 1946  company payroll reached  600 000 a week 127  and net profit  19 4 million  One problem for Warner Bros   however  was Jack Warner s refusal to meet Screen Actors Guild salary demands  128  In September 1946  the employees engaged in a month long strike  128  In retaliation  Warner during his 1947 testmony before Congress  for making the 1942 Russian propaganda film Mission to Moscow   accused a number of studio employees of having ties to Communists  129  By the end of 1947  the studio reached a record net profit of  22 million  130  This dropped 50  the following year  130  On January 5  1948  Warner offered the first color newsreel  covering the Tournament of Roses Parade and the Rose Bowl Game  In 1948  Bette Davis  still the studio s top actress and now fed up with Jack Warner  was a big problem for Harry after she and a number of her fellow colleagues left the studio after completing the film Beyond the Forest  131  Warner was a party to the United States v  Paramount Pictures  Inc  anti trust case of the 1940s  This action  brought by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission  claimed the five integrated studio theater chain combinations restrained competition  The Supreme Court heard the case in 1948  and ruled in favor of the government  As a result  Warner and four other major studios were forced to separate production from exhibition  In 1949  the studio s net profit was only  10 million  130  Warner Bros  set up two semi independent production units that made films for the studio  One of these was Harry Warner s son in law Milton Sperling s United States Pictures  Vivien Leigh as Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire  1951  In the early 1950s  the threat of television had grown greatly  and in 1953  Jack Warner decided to take a new approach to compete with the rising threat  132  In the wake of United Artists successful 3D film Bwana Devil  he decided to expand into 3D films with the studio s 1953 film House of Wax  133  Unfortunately  despite the success of House of Wax  3 D films soon lost their appeal among moviegoers  134  In 1952 Warner Bros  made their first film  Carson City  in  Warnercolor  the studio s name for Eastman Color  3 D almost caused the demise of the Warner Bros  cartoon studio  Having completed a 3D Bugs Bunny cartoon  Lumber Jack Rabbit  Jack Warner ordered the animation unit to be shut down  erroneously believing that all cartoons hence would be produced in the 3D process  Several months later  Warner relented and reopened the cartoon studio  Fortunately  Warner Bros  had enough of a backlog of cartoons and a healthy reissue program so that there was no noticeable interruption in the release schedule  After the downfall of 3D films  Harry Warner decided to use CinemaScope in future Warner Bros  films  135  One of the studio s first CinemaScope films  The High and the Mighty  now owned by John Wayne s company Batjac   enabled the studio to show a profit  136  Early in 1953  the Warner theater holdings were spun off as Stanley Warner Theaters  Stanley Warner s non theater holdings were sold to Simon Fabian Enterprises  137  and its theaters merged with RKO Theatres to become RKO Stanley Warner Theatres  138  By 1956  however  the studio was losing money  139  By the end of 1953  the studio s net profit was  2 9 million 140  and ranged between  2 and  4 million for the next two years  141  In February 1956  Jack Warner sold the rights to all of the studio s pre 1950 films to Associated Artists Productions  which merged with United Artists Television in 1958   142  143  In May 1956  the brothers announced they were putting Warner Bros  on the market  144  Jack  however  secretly organized a syndicate   headed by Boston banker Serge Semenenko 139   to purchase 800 000 shares  90  of the company s stock  139  After the three brothers sold  Jack   through his under the table deal   joined Semenenko s syndicate 145  and bought back all his stock  200 000 shares  145  Shortly after the deal was completed in July  146  Jack   now the company s largest stockholder   appointed himself new president  147  By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother s dealings  it was too late  146  Shortly after the deal was closed  Jack Warner announced the company and its subsidiaries would be  directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties  talents  and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible   148   edit  Warner Bros  Television By 1949  with the success of television threatening the film industry more and more  Harry Warner decided to shift his focus towards television production  132  However  the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  would not permit it  132  After an unsuccessful attempt to convince other movie studio bosses to switch their focus to television  Harry abandoned his television efforts  132  The other Warner brother  Jack  began his hatred of television with problems with Milton Berle being hired by the studio to make an unsuccessful film Always Leave Them Laughing during the peak of his television popularity  Warner felt that Berle was not strong enough as a lead to carry a film and that people would not pay to see the man they could see on television for free  However Jack Warner was pressured into using Berle  even replacing Danny Kaye with him  149  Berle s outrageous behaviour on the set and the film s massive failure proving Jack Warner right led to Jack Warner forbidding television sets appearing in the studio s film sets  150  On March 21  1955  the studio was finally able engage in television through the successful Warner Bros  Television unit run by William T  Orr  Jack Warner s son in law  Warner Bros  Television provided the ABC with a weekly show  Warner Bros  Presents  the show featured a rotating series of shows based on three of the studio s film successes  Kings Row  Casablanca and Cheyenne  followed by a promotion for one of Warner s big screen films  151  152  It was not a success  153  The studio s next effort  making a weekly series out of Cheyenne  would be  154 Cheyenne was television s first one hour Western with two episodes placed together for feature film release outside the United States  In the tradition of their B Pictures  the studio followed up with a series of rapidly produced popular Westerns  such as Maverick  Bronco  and Colt  45  154  The success of these series helped to make up for the losses on the film side  154  As a result  Jack Warner decided to emphasize television production  155  Warners then produced a series of popular private detective shows beginning with 77 Sunset Strip  1958 64  followed by Hawaiian Eye  1959 1963   Bourbon Street Beat  1960  and Surfside Six  1960 1962   Within a few years  the studio  in a matter reminiscent of their problems with James Cagney and Bette Davis  provoked hostility among their emerging contract TV stars like Clint Walker and James Garner  who sued over a contract dispute 156  and won  Edd Byrnes was not so lucky and bought himself out of his contract  Jack Warner was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors  who evidently showed more independence than film actors  and this deepened his contempt for the new medium  157  Many of Warners television stars appeared in the casts of Warner s cinema releases of the time  In 1963 as a result of a court decision Warners has to cease their contracts with their television stars  engaging them for specific series or film roles  In the same year Jack Webb took over the television unit and did not have any successes   edit  Warner Bros  Family Entertainment The family film label of Warner Bros   edit  Warner Bros  Records Warner Bros  was already the owner of extensive music publishing holdings  whose tunes had appeared in countless Warners cartoons  arranged by Carl Stalling  and television shows  arranged by Max Steiner 158    In 1958 the studio launched Warner Bros  Records  Initially the label released recordings made by their television stars whether they could sing or not and records based on the soundtracks of favourite Warner Bros  Television shows  In 1963  Jack Warner agreed to a  rescue takeover  of Frank Sinatra s Reprise Records  159  The deal gave Sinatra US 1 5 million and part ownership of Warner Bros  Records  with Reprise becoming a sub label  159  most significantly for Warner Bros  s future music operations  the deal also brought Reprise manager Morris  Mo  Ostin into the company  In 1964  upon seeing the profits record companies made from Warner film music  Jack Warner decided to claim ownership of the studio s film soundtracks and focus on making profits through Warner Bros  Records  160  In its first eighteen months  Warner Bros  Records lost around  2 million  161   edit  New owners Warner Bros  rebounded in the late 1950s  specializing in adaptations of popular plays like The Bad Seed  1956   No Time for Sergeant swift  1958   and Gypsy  1962   With his health slowly recovering from a car accident whilst on holiday to France in 1958  Jack returned to the studio and made sure his name was featured in studio press releases  162  In each of the first three years of the 1960s  the studio s net profit was a little over  7 million  162  Warner paid an unprecedented  5 5 million for the film rights to the Broadway musical My Fair Lady in February 1962  The previous owner  CBS director William S  Paley  set terms including half the distributor s gross profits  plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract   163  In 1963  the net profit dropped to  3 7 million  162  By the mid 1960s  motion picture production was in decline  There were few studio produced films and many more co productions  for which Warner provided facilities  money  and distribution   and pickups of independently made pictures  With the success of the studio s 1965 Broadway play The Great Race  161  as well as its soundtrack  161  Warner Bros  Records became a profitable subsidiary  The studio s 1966 film Who s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf  was a huge success at the box office  164  In November 1966  Jack gave in to advancing age and the changing times  165  selling control of the studio and its music business to Seven Arts Productions  run by the Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman  for  32 million  166  The company  including the studio  was renamed Warner Bros  Seven Arts  Jack Warner did  however  remain studio president until the summer of 1967  when Camelot failed at the box office and Warner gave up his position to the studio s longtime publicity director  Ben Kalmenson  167  Warner did  however  remain on board as an independent producer and vice president  166  With the success of the studio s 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde  Warner Bros was making profits once again  168  Two years later  the Hymans  now fed up with Jack Warner  168  accepted a cash and stock offer from an odd conglomerate called Kinney National Company for more than  64 million  168  Kinney owned a Hollywood talent agency  Ashley Famous  169  and it was Ted Ashley who led Kinney head Steve Ross to purchase Warner Bros  Ashley became the new head of the studio  and the name was changed to Warner Bros   Inc  once again  Jack Warner  however  was outraged by the Hymans  sale  168  and decided to retire  168  Although movie audiences had shrunk  Warner s new management believed in the drawing power of stars  signing co production deals with several of the biggest names of the day  among them Paul Newman  Robert Redford  Barbra Streisand  and Clint Eastwood  carrying the studio successfully through the 1970s and 1980s  Warner Bros  also made major profits on films built around the characters of Superman and Batman  owned by Warner Bros  subsidiary DC Comics  Abandoning the mundane parking lots and funeral homes  the refocused Kinney renamed itself in honor of its best known holding  Warner Communications  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Warner Communications branched out into other business  such as its acquiring of video game company Atari  Inc  in 1976  and later the Six Flags theme parks  From 1971 until the end of 1987  Warner s international distribution operations were a joint venture with Columbia Pictures  and in some countries  this joint venture also distributed films from other companies  like EMI Films and Cannon Films in the UK   Warner ended the venture in 1988 and joined up with Walt Disney Pictures  this joint venture lasted until 1993  when Disney created Buena Vista International  In 1972 in a cost cutting move  Warner and Columbia Pictures formed a partnership called The Burbank Studios in which they would share production facilities utilitizing the Warner lot in Burbank  The partnership ended in 1990 when Columbia moved into the former MGM studio lot in Culver City  To the surprise of many  flashy  star driven Warner Communications merged in 1989 with the white shoe publishing company Time Inc  Though Time and its magazines claimed a higher tone  it was the Warner Bros  film and music units which provided the profits  The Time Warner merger was almost derailed when Paramount Communications  Formerly Gulf Western  later sold to Viacom   launched a  12 2 billion dollar hostile takeover bid for Time Inc   forcing Time to acquire Warner for  14 9 billion dollar cash stock offer  Paramount responded with a lawsuit filed in Delaware court to break up the merger  Paramount lost and the merger proceeded  In 1997  Time Warner sold the Six Flags unit  The takeover of Time Warner in 2000 by then high flying AOL did not prove a good match  and following the collapse in  dot com  stocks  the AOL name was banished from the corporate nameplate   edit  Since 1995 A panoramic view over today s studio premises  In 1995  Warner and station owner Tribune Company of Chicago launched The WB Network  finding a niche market in teenagers  The WB s early programming included an abundance of teenage fare like Buffy the Vampire Slayer  Smallville  Dawson s Creek  and One Tree Hill  Two dramas produced by Spelling Television  7th Heaven and Charmed also helped bring The WB into the spotlight  with  Charmed  lasting eight seasons and being the longest running drama with female leads

The sixth was slated for November 2008  but Warner moved it to July 2009 only three months before the movie was supposed to come out  citing the lack of summer blockbusters in 2009  due to the Writer s Strike  as the reason  170  The decision was purely financial  and Alan Horn said   There were no delays  I ve seen the movie  It is fabulous  We would have been perfectly able to have it out in November   171  This resulted in a massive fan backlash  172  The seventh and final adaptation was released in two parts  Part 1 in November 2010 and Part 2 in July 2011  Over the years  Warner Bros
