Hall and five storey pagoda of H ry  ji  among the oldest wooden buildings in the world  National Treasures  and a UNESCO World Heritage Site A Paleolithic culture around 30 000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of Japan  This was followed from around 14 000 BC  the start of the J mon period  by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi sedentary hunter gatherer culture  who include ancestors of both the contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people  17  18  characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture  19  Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world  Around 300 BC  the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands  intermingling with the J mon  20  The Yayoi period  starting around 500 BC  saw the introduction of practices like wet rice farming  21  a new style of pottery  22  and metallurgy  introduced from China and Korea  23  The Japanese first appear in written history in the Chinese Book of Han

art  poetry and prose  Lady Murasaki s The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan s national anthem Kimigayo were written during this time  28  Buddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly through two major sects  Tendai by Saich   and Shingon by K kai  Pure Land Buddhism greatly becomes popular in the latter half of the 11th century  Feudal era Japan s feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors  the samurai  In 1185  following the defeat of the Taira clan  sung in the epic Tale of Heike  samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shogun and established a base of power in Kamakura  After his death  the H j  clan came to power as regents for the shoguns  The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period  1185 1333  and became popular among the samurai class  29  The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281  but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go Daigo  Go Daigo was himself

position to gain political and military support  When open war broke out  he defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600  Ieyasu was appointed shogun in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo  modern Tokyo   32  The Tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto  as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyo  33  and in 1639  the isolationist sakoku   closed country   policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period  1603 1868   34  The study of Western sciences  known as rangaku  continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki  The Edo period also gave rise to kokugaku   national studies    the study of Japan by the Japanese  35  Modern era On March 31  1854  Commodore Matthew Perry and the  Black Ships  of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa  Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises  The resignation of the shogun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the Emperor  the Meiji Restoration   36  Adopting Western political  judicial and military institutions  the Cabinet organized the Privy Council  introduced the Meiji Constitution  and assembled the Imperial Diet  The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence  After victories in the First Sino Japanese War  1894 1895  and the Russo Japanese War  1904 1905   Japan gained control of Taiwan  Korea  and the southern half of Sakhalin  37  Japan s population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935

increasing expansionism and militarization  World War I enabled Japan  on the side of the victorious Allies  to widen its influence and territorial holdings  It continued its expansionist policy by occupying Manchuria in 1931  as a result of international condemnation of this occupation  Japan resigned from the League of Nations two years later  In 1936  Japan signed the Anti Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany  and the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers  39  In 1941  Japan negotiated the Soviet Japanese Neutrality Pact  40  The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in

in 1945  Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on August 15  44  The war cost Japan and the rest of the Greater East Asia Co Prosperity Sphere millions of lives and left much of the nation s industry and infrastructure destroyed  The Allies  led by the US  repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia  largely eliminating the Japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories  45  The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East on May 3  1946 to prosecute some Japanese leaders for war crimes  However  the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the Supreme Allied Commander despite calls for trials for both groups  46  In 1947  Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices  The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 47  and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956  Japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second largest economy in the world  until surpassed by China in 2010  This ended in the mid 1990s when Japan suffered a major recession  In the beginning of the 21st century  positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery  48  On March 11  2011  Japan suffered the strongest earthquake in

period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki  54  However  since the late 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe  notably Germany  For example  in 1896  the Japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the German B rgerliches Gesetzbuch  with post World War II modifications  the code remains in effect  55  Statutory law originates

 Tokyo Autumn leaves  momiji  at Kong bu ji on Mount K ya  a UNESCO World Heritage Site Japan has a total of 6 852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of East Asia  71  72  The country  including all of the islands it controls  lies between latitudes 24  and 46 N  and longitudes 122  and 146 E  The main islands  from north to south  are Hokkaid   Honsh   Shikoku and Ky sh   The Ry ky  Islands  including Okinawa  are a chain to the south of Ky sh   Together they are often known as the Japanese Archipelago  73  About 73 percent of Japan is forested  mountainous  and unsuitable for agricultural  industrial  or residential use  2  74  As a result  the habitable zones  mainly located in coastal areas  have extremely high population densities  Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world  75  The islands of Japan are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire  They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south  and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north  Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent  The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward  opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago  76  Japan has 108 active volcanoes  Destructive earthquakes  often resulting in tsunami  occur several times each century  77  The 1923 Tokyo earthquake

triggered a large tsunami  49  Climate Main article  Climate of Japan The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate  but varies greatly from north to south  Japan s geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones  Hokkaid   Sea of Japan  Central Highland  Seto Inland Sea  Pacific Ocean  and Ry ky  Islands  The northernmost zone  Hokkaido  has a temperate climate with long  cold winters and cool summers  Precipitation is not heavy  but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter  In the Sea of Japan zone on Honsh  s west coast  northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall  In the summer  the region is cooler than the Pacific area  though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn wind  The Central Highland has a typical inland climate  with large temperature differences between summer and winter  and between day and night  precipitation is light  The mountains of the Ch goku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds  bringing mild weather year round  The Pacific coast experiences cold winters with little snowfall and hot  humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind  The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate  with warm winters and hot summers  Precipitation is very heavy  especially during the rainy season  80  The average winter temperature in Japan is 5 1  C  41 2  F  and the average summer temperature is 25 2  C  77 4  F   81  The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 40 9  C  105 6  F  was recorded on August 16  2007  82  The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa  and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaid  in late July  In most of Honsh   the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks  In late summer and early autumn  typhoons often bring heavy rain  83  Biodiversity Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands  They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry ky  and Bonin Islands  to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands  to temperate coniferous forests in the cold  winter portions of the northern islands  84  Japan has over 90 000 species of wildlife  including the brown bear  the Japanese macaque  the Japanese raccoon dog  and the Japanese giant salamander  85  A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty seven Ramsar wetland sites  86  87  Environment Main article  Environmental issues in Japan In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II  environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations  as a result  environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s  Responding to rising concern about the problem  the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970  88  The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy due to Japan s lack of natural resources  89  Current environmental issues include urban air pollution  NOx  suspended particulate matter  and toxics   waste management  water eutrophication  nature conservation  climate change  chemical management and international co operation for conservation  90  Japan is one of the world s leaders in the development of new environment friendly technologies  and is ranked 20th best in the world in the 2010 Environmental Performance Index  91  As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol  and host of the 1997 conference which

post war economic miracle  it averaged 7 5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s  and 3 2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s  97  Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s during what the Japanese call the Lost Decade  largely because of the after effects of the Japanese asset price bubble and domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets  Government efforts to revive economic growth met with little success and were further hampered by the global slowdown in 2000  2  The economy showed strong signs of recovery after 2005  GDP growth for that year was 2 8
