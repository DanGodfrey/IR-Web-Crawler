his wife  Jane Grant  a New York Times reporter  Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine different from corny humor publications such as Judge  where he had worked  or Life  Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H  Fleischmann to establish the F R Publishing Company and established the magazine s first offices at 25 West 45th Street in Manhattan  Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951  During the early  occasionally precarious years of its existence  the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication  Harold Ross famously declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine   It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque   2  Although the magazine never lost its touches of humor  it soon established itself as a pre eminent forum for serious fiction literature and journalism  Shortly after the end of World War II  John Hersey s essay Hiroshima filled an entire issue  In subsequent decades the magazine published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the 20th and 21st centuries  including Ann Beattie  John Cheever  Roald Dahl  John McNulty  Alice Munro  Haruki Murakami  Vladimir Nabokov  John O Hara  Philip Roth  J D  Salinger  Irwin Shaw  James Thurber  John Updike  Eudora Welty  and E  B  White  Publication of Shirley Jackson s  The Lottery  drew more mail than any other story in The New Yorker s history  In its early decades  the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories a week  but in recent years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue  While some styles and themes recur more often than others in New Yorker fiction  the magazine s stories are marked less by uniformity than by variety  and they have ranged from Updike s introspective domestic narratives to the surrealism of Donald Barthelme  and from parochial accounts of the lives of neurotic New Yorkers to stories set in a wide range of locations and eras and translated from many languages  citation needed  Writers like Kurt Vonnegut said that The New Yorker has been an effective institution for getting a large audience through the learning process required for appreciating modern literature  3  The non fiction feature articles  which usually make up the bulk of the magazine s content  cover an eclectic array of topics  Recent subjects have included eccentric evangelist Creflo Dollar  the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time and Munchausen syndrome by proxy  The magazine is notable for its editorial traditions  Under the rubric Profiles  it has long published articles about a range of notable people  from Ernest Hemingway  Henry R  Luce and Marlon Brando to Hollywood restaurateur Michael Romanoff  magician Ricky Jay and mathematicians David and Gregory Chudnovsky  Other enduring features have been  Goings on About Town   a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York  and  The Talk of the Town   a miscellany of brief pieces frequently humorous  whimsical or eccentric vignettes of life in New York written in a breezily light style  or feuilleton  although in recent years the section often begins with a serious commentary  For many years  newspaper snippets containing amusing errors  unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors   Block That Metaphor   have been used as filler items  accompanied by a witty retort  There is no masthead listing the editors and staff  And despite some changes  the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography  layout  covers and artwork  The magazine was acquired by Advance Publications  the media company owned by S I  Newhouse  in 1985  Ross was succeeded by William Shawn  1951 1987   followed by Robert Gottlieb  1987 1992  and Tina Brown  1992 1998   Brown s nearly six year tenure attracted the most controversy  thanks to her high profile  a marked contrast to that of the retiring Shawn  and the changes she made to a magazine that had retained a similar look and feel for the previous half century  She introduced color to the editorial pages  several years before The New York Times also did so  and photography  with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout  More substantively  she increased the coverage of current events and hot topics such as celebrities and business tycoons and placed short pieces throughout  Goings on About Town   including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan  A new letters to the editor page and the addition of authors  bylines to their  Talk of the Town  pieces had the effect of making the magazine more personal  The current editor of The New Yorker is David Remnick  who took over in 1998 from Brown  Wrote Tom Wolfe about the magazine s style   The New Yorker style was one of leisurely meandering understatement  droll when in the humorous mode  tautological and litotical when in the serious mode  constantly amplified  qualified  adumbrated upon  nuanced and renuanced  until the magazine s pale gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier   4  As far back as the 1940s the magazine s commitment to fact checking was already well known  5  Yet the magazine played a role in a literary scandal and defamation lawsuit over two articles by Janet Malcolm about Sigmund Freud s legacy  that appeared in the 1990s  Questions were raised about the magazine s fact checking process  6  As of 2010  The New Yorker employs 16 fact checkers  7 In July  2011  the magazine was sued for defamation in United States district court for a July 12  2010 article written by David Grann  8  Since the late 1990s  The New Yorker has used the Internet to publish current and archived material  It maintains a website with some content from the current issue  plus exclusive web only content   Subscribers have access to the full current issue online  as well as a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed  In addition  The New Yorker s cartoons are available for purchase online  A digital archive of back issues from 1925 to April 2008  representing more than 4 000 issues and half a million pages  has also been issued on DVD ROMs and on a small portable hard drive  More recently  an iPad version of the current issue of the magazine has been released  A New Yorker look alike  Novy Ochevidets  The New Eyewitness   was launched in Russia in 2004  It folded in January 2005 after five months of circulation  In its November 1  2004 issue  the magazine for the first time endorsed a presidential candidate  citation needed  choosing to endorse John Kerry over George W  Bush  9  They continued this in 2008  endorsing Barack Obama over John McCain  10   edit  Cartoons The New Yorker has featured cartoons  usually gag cartoons  since it began publication in 1925  The cartoon editor of The New Yorker for years was Lee Lorenz  who first began cartooning in 1956 and became a New Yorker contract contributor in 1958  After serving as the magazine s art editor from 1973 to 1993  when he was replaced by Fran oise Mouly   he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998  His book  The Art of the New Yorker  1925 1995  Knopf  1995   was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine s graphics  In 1998  Robert Mankoff took over as cartoon editor  and since then Mankoff has edited at least 14 collections of New Yorker cartoons  The New Yorker s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor  including Charles Addams  Peter Arno  Charles Barsotti  George Booth  Roz Chast  Tom Cheney  Sam Cobean  Leo Cullum  Richard Decker  Helen E  Hokinson  Ed Koren  Mary Petty  George Price  Charles Saxon  David Snell  Otto Soglow  Saul Steinberg  William Steig  Richard Taylor  James Thurber  Barney Tobey and Gahan Wilson  Many early New Yorker cartoonists did not caption their own cartoons  In his book The Years with Ross  Thurber describes the newspaper s weekly art meeting  where cartoons submitted over the previous week would be brought up from the mail room to be gone over by Ross  the editorial department and a number of staff writers  Cartoons would often be rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments  while others would be accepted and captions written for them  Some artists hired their own writers  Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931   Brendan Gill relates in his book Here at The New Yorker that at one point in the early 1940s  the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve  It was later found out that the office boy  a teenaged Truman Capote  had been acting as a volunteer art editor  dropping pieces he didn t like down the far edge of his desk   11  Several of the magazine s cartoons have climbed to a higher plateau of fame  One 1928 cartoon drawn by Carl Rose and captioned by E  B  White shows a mother telling her daughter   It s broccoli  dear   The daughter responds   I say it s spinach and I say the hell with it   Three years later  the Broadway musical Face the Music featured a musical number named  I Say It s Spinach   12  The catchphrase  back to the drawing board  originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane  saying   Well  back to the old drawing board   13  14  The most reprinted is Peter Steiner s 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer  with one saying   On the Internet  nobody knows you re a dog   According to Mankoff  Steiner and the magazine have split more than  100 000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon  with more than half going to Steiner  15  16  Over seven decades  many hardcover compilations of cartoons from The New Yorker have been published  and in 2004  Mankoff edited The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker  a 656 page collection with 2004 of the magazine s best cartoons published during 80 years  plus a double CD set with all 68 647 cartoons ever published in the magazine  This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by a cartoonist s name or by year of publication  The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes Pat Byrnes  Frank Cotham  Michael Crawford  Joe Dator  Drew Dernavich  J C  Duffy  Carolita Johnson  P C  Vey  Zachary Kanin  Farley Katz  Glen Le Lievre  Michael Maslin  Ariel Molvig  Paul Noth  Barbara Smaller  David Sipress  Mick Stevens  Julia Suits  Christopher Weyant and Jack Ziegler  The notion that some New Yorker cartoons have punchlines so non sequitur that they are impossible to understand became a subplot in the Seinfeld episode  The Cartoon   as well as a playful jab in an episode of The Simpsons   The Sweetest Apu   In April 2005  the magazine began using the last page of each issue for  The New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest   Captionless cartoons by The New Yorker s regular cartoonists are printed each week  Captions are submitted by readers  and three are chosen as finalists  Readers then vote on the winner  and any U S  resident age 18 or older can vote  Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon  with the winning caption   signed by the artist who drew the cartoon   edit  Films The New Yorker has been the source of a number of movies  Both fiction and non fiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen  including  Flash of Genius  2008   based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by John Seabrook  Away From Her  adapted from Alice Munro s short story  The Bear Came Over The Mountain   which debuted at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival  The Namesake  2007   similarly based on Jhumpa Lahiri s novel which originated as a short story in the magazine  The Bridge  2006   based on Tad Friend s 2003 non fiction piece  Jumpers   Brokeback Mountain  2005   an adaptation of the short story by Annie Proulx which first appeared in the October 13  1997  issue of The New Yorker  Jonathan Safran Foer s 2001 debut in The New Yorker  which later came to theaters in Liev Schreiber s debut as both screenwriter and director  Everything is Illuminated  2005   Michael Cunningham s The Hours  which appeared in the pages of The New Yorker before becoming the film that garnered the 2002 Best Actress Academy Award for Nicole Kidman  Adaptation  2002   which Charlie Kaufman based on Susan Orlean s The Orchid Thief  written for The New Yorker  Frank McCourt s Angela s Ashes  which also appeared  in part  in The New Yorker in 1996 before its film adaptation was released in 1999  The Addams Family  1991  and its sequel  Addams Family Values  1993   both inspired by the work of famed New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams  Brian De Palma s Casualties of War  1989   which began as a New Yorker article by Daniel Lang  Boys Don t Cry  1999   starring Hilary Swank  began as an article in the magazine  and Iris  2001   about the life of Iris Murdoch and John Bayley  the article written by John Bayley for the New Yorker  before he completed his full memoir  the film starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent  The Swimmer  1968   starring Burt Lancaster  based on a John Cheever short story from The New Yorker  In Cold Blood  1967   the widely nominated adaptation of the 1965 non fiction serial written for The New Yorker by Truman Capote  Pal Joey  1957   based on a series of stories by John O Hara  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty  1947  which began as a story by longtime New Yorker contributor James Thurber  and Meet Me in St  Louis  1944   adapted from Sally Benson s short stories  The history of The New Yorker has also been portrayed in film  In Mrs  Parker and the Vicious Circle  a film about the celebrated Algonquin Round Table starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dorothy Parker  Sam Robards portrays founding editor Harold Ross trying to drum up support for his fledgling publication  The magazine s former editor  William Shawn  is portrayed in Capote  2005  and Infamous  2006    edit  Style One uncommonly formal feature of the magazine s in house style is the placement of diaeresis marks in words with repeating vowels such as re lected  pre minent and co perate in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds  The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used  such as  focusses  and  venders   The magazine does not put the titles of plays or books in italics but simply sets them off with quotation marks  When referring to other publications that include locations in their names  it uses italics only for the  non location  portion of the name  such as the Los Angeles Times or the Chicago Tribune  Formerly  when a word or phrase in quotation marks came at the end of a phrase or clause that ended with a semicolon  the semicolon would be put before the trailing quotation mark  now  however  the magazine follows the more commonly observed style and puts the semicolon after the second quotation mark  The magazine also spells out the names of numbers  such as  twenty five hundred  instead of  2500   even for very large figures  It also spells out professional sports leagues with periods  e g  N B A  The New Yorker s signature display typeface  used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above The Talk of the Town section  is Irvin  named after its creator  the designer illustrator Rea Irvin  17  The body text of all articles in The New Yorker is set in Adobe Caslon  18   edit  Readership Notwithstanding its title  The New Yorker is read nationwide with 53  of its circulation in the top ten U S  metropolitan areas  According to Mediamark Research Inc   the average age of the New Yorker reader in 2009 is 47  compared to 43 in 1980 and 46 in 1990   The average household income of The New Yorker readers in 2009 is  109 877  the average income in 1980 was  62 788 and the average income in 1990 is  70 233   19  Also according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations  The New Yorker s renewal rate  the percentage of subscribers who renew their subscription each year  is 85  one of the highest reported rates in the industry  Mediamark Research Inc  reported that readers spend  on average  81 minutes each week reading The New Yorker   edit  Eustace Tilley The magazine s first cover illustration  a dandy peering at a butterfly through a monocle  was drawn by Rea Irvin  the magazine s first art editor  based on an 1834 caricature of the then Count d Orsay which appeared as an illustration 20  in the 11th edition of the Encyclop dia Britannica  The gentleman on the original cover  now referred to as  Eustace Tilley   is a character created by Corey Ford for The New Yorker  The hero of a series entitled  The Making of a Magazine   which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer  Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover  His top hat was of a newer style  without the curved brim  He wore a morning coat and striped trousers  Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley s last name from an aunt he had always found it vaguely humorous   Eustace  was selected for euphony  although Ford may have borrowed the name from Eustace Taylor  his fraternity brother from Delta Kappa Epsilon at Columbia College of Columbia University  Tilley was always busy  and in illustrations by Johann Bull  always poised  He might be in Mexico  supervising the vast farms that grew the cactus for binding the magazine s pages together  The Punctuation Farm  where commas were grown in profusion  because Ross had developed a love of them  was naturally in a more fertile region  Tilley might be inspecting the Initial Department  where letters were sent to be capitalized  Or he might be superintending the Emphasis Department  where letters were placed in a vise and forced sideways  for the creation of italics  He would jump to the Sargasso Sea  where by insulting squids he got ink for the printing presses  which were powered by a horse turning a pole  It was told how in the great paper shortage of 1882 he had saved the magazine by getting society matrons to contribute their finery  Thereafter dresses were made at a special factory and girls employed to wear them out  after which the cloth was used for manufacturing paper  Raoul Fleischmann  who had moved into the offices to protect his venture with Ross  gathered the Tilley series into a promotion booklet  Later  Ross took a listing for Eustace Tilley in the Manhattan telephone directory  The character has become a kind of mascot for The New Yorker  frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials  Traditionally  Rea Irvin s original Tilley cover illustration is reused every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21  though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted   edit  Covers  edit   View of the World  cover Saul Steinberg s  View of the World from Ninth Avenue  cover  Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine  His most famous work is probably its March 29  1976 cover  21  an illustration titled  View of the World from 9th Avenue   sometimes referred to as  A Parochial New Yorker s View of the World  or  A New Yorker s View of the World   which depicts a map of the world as seen by self absorbed New Yorkers  The illustration is split in two  with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan s 9th Avenue  10th Avenue  and the Hudson River  appropriately labeled   and the top half depicting the rest of the world  The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square  with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing  Jersey   the names of five cities  Los Angeles  Washington  D C   Las Vegas  Kansas City  and Chicago  and three states  Texas  Utah  and Nebraska  scattered among a few rocks for the U S  beyond New Jersey  The Pacific Ocean  perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson  separates the U S  from three flattened land masses labeled China  Japan and Russia  The illustration humorously depicting New Yorkers  self image of their place in the world  or perhaps outsiders  view of New Yorkers  self image inspired many similar works  including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson  that movie poster led to a lawsuit  Steinberg v  Columbia Pictures Industries  Inc   663 F  Supp  706  S D N Y  1987   which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright that Steinberg held on his work  The cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of The New Yorker on October 6  2008  The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska and in the very background Russia  22  The March 21  2009 cover of The Economist   How China sees the World   is also an homage to the original image  but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing s Chang An street instead of Manhattan  23   edit  9 11 Hired by Tina Brown in 1992  Art Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years but resigned a few months after the September 11 terrorist attacks  The cover created by Spiegelman and Fran oise Mouly for the September 24  2001 issue of The New Yorker received wide acclaim and was voted in the top ten of magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors  which commented  New Yorker Covers Editor Fran oise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman s silhouettes  inspired by Ad Reinhardt s black on black paintings  so that the North Tower s antenna breaks the  W  of the magazine s logo  Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness  and find the awful awe filled image of all that disappeared the on 9 11  The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth  black ink  on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks  An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger  insisting on their presence through the blackness  At first glance  the cover appears to be totally black  but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black  In some situations  the ghost images only become visible when the magazine is tilted toward a light source  24  In September 2004  Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book In the Shadow of No Towers  in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and the psychological after effects   edit   New Yorkistan  Main article  New Yorkistan In the December 2001 issue the magazine printed a cover by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood s real name or characteristics  e g   Fuhgeddabouditstan    Botoxia    The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11 and became a popular print and poster   edit  Controversial covers  edit  Crown Heights in 1993 For the 1993 Valentine s Day issue  the magazine printed a cover by Art Spiegelman depicting a black woman and a Hasidic Jewish man kissing  referencing the Crown Heights riot of 1991  25  26  The cover was criticized by both black and Jewish observers  27  Jack Salzman and Cornel West describe the reaction to the cover as the magazine s  first national controversy   28   edit  2008 Obama cover satire and controversy Barry Blitt s cover from the July 21  2008 issue of The New Yorker Wikinews has related news  New Yorker s Obama cover sparks outrage  The Politics of Fear   a cartoon by Barry Blitt featured on the cover of the July 21  2008  issue  depicts then presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in the turban and salwar kameez typical of many Muslims  fist bumping with his wife  Michelle  portrayed with an Afro and wearing camouflage trousers with an AK 47 assault rifle slung over her back  They are standing in the Oval Office  with a portrait of Osama Bin Laden hanging on the wall and an American flag burning in the fireplace in the background  29  Many New Yorker readers saw the image as a lampoon of  The Politics of Fear   as the image was titled  Some of Obama s supporters as well as his presumptive Republican opponent  Sen  John McCain  accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers  The New Yorker s editor David Remnick said   The intent of the cover is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the blogosphere and are reflected in public opinion polls  What we set out to do was to throw all these images together  which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them  to satirize them   30  citing the excesses in the image to rebuff the concern that it could be misunderstood  even by those unfamiliar with the magazine  31  32  In an interview on Larry King Live shortly after the magazine issue began circulating  Obama said  Well  I know it was The New Yorker s attempt at satire    I don t think they were entirely successful with it     But Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations portrayed in The New Yorker cover through a web site his campaign set up    They are  actually an insult against Muslim Americans  something that we don t spend a lot of time talking about    33  34  Later that week  The Daily Show s Jon Stewart continued The New Yorker cover s argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources  35  The New Yorker Obama cover was later parodied by Stewart and Stephen Colbert on the October 3  2008  cover of Entertainment Weekly magazine  with Stewart as Obama and Colbert as Michelle  photographed exclusively for the magazine in New York City on September 18  36  New Yorker covers are not always related to the contents of the magazine or are only tangentially so  In this case  the article in the July 21  2008  issue about Obama did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama s political career to date  The New Yorker later endorsed Obama for president   edit  See also New York City portal Culture of New York City List of The New Yorker contributors Media of New York City

Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut quote  One thing we used to talk about   when I was out in Iowa   was that the limiting factor is the reader  No other art requires the audience to be a performer  You have to count on the reader s being a good performer  and you may write music which he absolutely can t perform   in which case it s a bust  Those writers you mentioned and myself are teaching an audience how to play this kind of music in their heads  It s a learning process  and The New Yorker has been a very good institution of the sort needed  They have a captive audience  and they come out every week  and people finally catch on to Barthelme  for instance  and are able to perform that sort of thing in their heads and enjoy it  I think the same is true of S  J  Perelman  I do not think that Perelman would be appreciated if suddenly his collected works were to be published now to be seen for the first time  It would be gibberish  A learning process is required to appreciate Perelman  although it s very easy to do once you learn how to do it  Yeah  I think the readers are coming along  that s a problem  I think writers have tried to do it always and have failed because there s been
