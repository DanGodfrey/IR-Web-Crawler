bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and south  New Hampshire to the west  and the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the northwest and New Brunswick to the northeast  Maine is both the northernmost and easternmost portion of New England  It is known for its scenery its jagged  mostly rocky coastline  its low  rolling mountains  its heavily forested interior and picturesque waterways as well as for its seafood cuisine  especially lobsters and clams  For thousands of years  indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine  At the time of European encounter  several Algonquian speaking peoples inhabited the area  The first European settlement in Maine was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island  by Pierre Dugua  Sieur de Mons  The first English settlement in Maine  the short lived Popham Colony  was established by the Plymouth Company in 1607  A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s  although the rugged climate  deprivations  and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years  As Maine entered the 18th century  only a half dozen European settlements survived  Patriot and British forces contended for Maine s territory during the American Revolution and the War of 1812  Maine was part of Massachusetts until March 15  1820  when it became the 23rd state under the Missouri Compromise  Maine is the 39th most extensive and the 41st most populous of the 50 United States  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Climate 2 History 2 1 Etymology 3 Demographics 3 1 Race  ancestry

New Brunswick  a province of Canada  The Canadian province of Quebec is to the northwest  Maine is both the northernmost state in New England and the largest  accounting for nearly half the region s entire land area  Maine has the distinction of being the only state to border just one other state  New Hampshire to the west   Maine is the easternmost state in the United States both in terms of its extreme points and its geographic center  The municipalities of Eastport and Lubec are  respectively  the easternmost city and town in the United States  Estcourt Station is Maine s northernmost point  as well as the northernmost point in New England   For more information see extreme points of the United States   Maine s Moosehead Lake is the largest lake wholly in New England  as Lake Champlain is located between Vermont and New York  A number of other Maine lakes  such as South Twin Lake  are described by Thoreau  Mount Katahdin is both the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail  which extends southerly to Springer Mountain  Georgia  and the southern terminus of the new International Appalachian Trail which  when complete  will run to Belle Isle  Newfoundland and Labrador  Maine has several unique geographical features  Machias Seal Island and North Rock  off its easternmost point  are claimed by both the U S  and Canada and are within one of four areas between the two countries whose sovereignty is still in dispute  but it is the only one of the disputed areas containing land  Also in this easternmost area is the Old Sow  the largest tidal whirlpool in the Western Hemisphere  Maine is the least densely populated U S  state east of the Mississippi River  It is called the Pine Tree State  nearly 90  of its land is forested  7  In the forested areas of the interior lie much uninhabited land  some of which does not have formal political organization into local units  a rarity in New England   The Northwest Aroostook  Maine unorganized territory in the northern part of the state  for example  has an area of 2 668 square miles  6 910 km2  and a population of 27  or one person for every 100 square miles  260 km2   Maine is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome  The land near the southern and central Atlantic coast is covered by the mixed oaks of the Northeastern coastal forests  The remainder of the state  including the North Woods  is covered by the New England Acadian forests  8  Maine has almost 230 miles  400 km  of coastline  and 3 500 miles  5 600 km  of tidal coastline   9  10 West Quoddy Head is the easternmost piece of land in the contiguous 48 United States  Along the famous rock bound coast of Maine are lighthouses  beaches  fishing villages  and thousands of offshore islands  including the Isles of Shoals  which straddle the New Hampshire border  There are jagged rocks and cliffs and many bays and inlets  Inland are lakes  rivers  forests  and mountains  This visual contrast of forested slopes sweeping down to the sea has been summed up by American poet Edna St  Vincent Millay of Rockland and Camden  Maine in  Renascence   The coast in Maine near Acadia park   All I could see from where I stood was three long mountains and a wood I turned and looked the other way and saw three islands in a bay  Geologists describe this type of landscape as a  drowned coast   where a rising sea level has invaded former land features  creating bays out of valleys and islands out of mountain tops  11  A rise in the elevation of the land due to the melting of heavy glacier ice caused a slight rebounding effect of underlying rock  this land rise  however  was not enough to eliminate all the effect of the rising sea level and its invasion of former land features  Much of Maine s geography was created by heavy glacial activity at the end of the last ice age  Prominent glacial features include Somes Sound and Bubble Rock  Carved by glaciers  Somes Sound is considered to be the only fjord on the eastern seaboard and reaches depths of 175 feet  50 m   The extreme depth and steep drop off allow large ships to navigate almost the entire length of the sound  These features also have made it attractive for boat builders  such as the prestigious Hinckley Yachts  Bubble Rock is what is known as a  glacial erratic  and is a large boulder perched on the edge of Bubble Mountain in Acadia National Park  By analyzing the type of granite  geologists were able to discover that glaciers carried Bubble Rock to its present location from the town of Lucerne   30 miles  48 km  away  Boothbay Harbor Acadia National Park is the only

The original inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine were Algonquian speaking Wabanaki peoples including the Abenaki  Passamaquoddy  Maliseet and Penobscot  The first European settlement in what is now called Maine was in 1604 on Saint Croix Island  by Pierre Dugua  Sieur de Mons  including Samuel de Champlain  the noted explorer  The French named the entire area  including the portion that later became the State of Maine  Acadia  The first English settlement in Maine was established by the Plymouth Company at Popham in 1607  the same year as the settlement at Jamestown  Virginia The Popham colonists returned to England after 14 months   16  Two Jesuit missions were established by the French  one on Penobscot Bay in 1609  and the other on Mount Desert Island in 1613  The same year  Castine was established by Claude de La Tour  In 1625  Charles de Saint  tienne de la Tour erected Fort Pentagouet to protect Castine  The coastal areas of western Maine first became the Province of Maine in a 1622 land patent  Eastern Maine north of the Kennebec River was more sparsely settled and was known in the 17th century as the Territory of Sagadahock  A second settlement was attempted at a place called York  in 1623 by English explorer and naval Captain Christopher Levett  granted 6 000 acres  24 km2  by King Charles I of England  17  That settlement also failed  Central Maine was formerly inhabited by people of the Androscoggin tribe  also known as Arosaguntacook  The Androscoggin were a tribe in the Abenaki nation  They were driven out of the area in 1690 during King Philip s War  They were relocated at St  Francis  Canada  which was destroyed by Rogers  Rangers in 1759  and is now Odanak  The other Abenaki tribes suffered several severe defeats  particularly during Dummer s War  with the capture of Norridgewock in 1724 and the defeat of the Pequawket in 1725  which greatly reduced their numbers  They finally withdrew to Canada  where they were settled at B cancour and Sillery  and later at St  Francis  along with other refugee tribes from the south  18  The province within its current boundaries became part of Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1652  Maine was much fought over by the French  English and allied natives during the 17th and early 18th centuries  who conducted raids against each other  taking captives for ransom or  in some cases  adoption by Native American tribes  For instance  the Abenaki took captives taken during raids of Massachusetts in Queen Anne s War of the early 1700s to Kahnewake  a Catholic Mohawk village near Montreal  where some were adopted and others ransomed  19  20  After the English defeated the French in Acadia in the 1740s  the territory from the Penobscot River east fell under the nominal authority of the Province of Nova Scotia  and together with present day New Brunswick formed the Nova Scotia county of Sunbury  with its court of general sessions at Campobello  American and British forces contended for Maine s territory during the American Revolution and the War of 1812  and British forces occupied eastern Maine in both conflicts  21  The treaty concluding revolution was ambiguous about Maine s boundary with British North America  The territory of Maine was confirmed as part of Massachusetts when the United States was formed  although the final border with British territory was not established until the Webster Ashburton Treaty of 1842  Maine was physically separate from the rest of Massachusetts  Long standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede  the vote failed  Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the War of 1812 when Massachusetts pro British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders  In 1819  Massachusetts agreed to permit secession if voters in Maine approved  Due to these considerations and rapid population growth  in 1820 Maine voted to secede from Massachusetts  The secession and formation of the state of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15  1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise  which geographically limited the spread of slavery and enabled the admission to statehood of Missouri the following year  while keeping a balance between slave and free states  22  23  24  Maine s original capital was Portland  the largest city in Maine  until it was moved to Augusta in 1832 to make it more central within the state  The 20th Maine  under the command of Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain  defended Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg  Its soldiers prevented the Union Army from being flanked by the Confederate Army  Four U S  Navy ships have been named USS Maine in honor of the state   edit  Etymology There is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name  Maine   The state legislature in 2001 adopted a resolution establishing Franco American Day  which stated that the state was named after the former French province of Maine  25  Other theories mention earlier places with similar names  or claim it is a nautical reference to the mainland  26  The first known record of the name appears in an Aug  10  1622 land charter to Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason  English Royal Navy veterans  who were granted a large tract in present day Maine that Mason and Gorges  intend to name The Province of Maine   Mason had served in Royal Navy in the Orkney Islands where the chief island was called Mainland  a more likely name derivation for these English sailors than the French province  27  A year later  in 1623  the English naval captain Christopher Levett  exploring the New England coast  wrote   The first place I set my foote upon in New England was the Isle of Shoulds  being Ilands  sic  in the sea  above two Leagues from the Mayne   28  Whatever the origin  the name was fixed in 1665 when the King s Commissioners ordered that the  Province of Maine  be entered from then on in official records  29   edit  Demographics Maine Population Density Map  Historical populations Census

includes a natural increase since the last census of 6 413 people  that is 71 276 births minus 64 863 deaths  and an increase due to net migration of 41 808 people into the state  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 5 004 people  and migration within the country produced a net increase of 36 804 people  The population density of the state is 41 3 people per

prior to 1842  In northern Maine   particularly Aroostook County   Acadians still speak French at home  since their relatives live in neighboring New Brunswick  The area was once known as the Republic of Madawaska  before the frontier was decided in the Webster Ashburton Treaty of 1842  Over one quarter of the population of Lewiston  Waterville  and Biddeford are Franco American  Most of the residents of the midcoast and downeast sections are chiefly of British heritage  Smaller numbers of various other groups  including Irish  Italian and Polish  have settled throughout the state since the late 19th and early 20th century immigration waves  The 2000 Census reported 92 25  of Maine residents age 5 and older speak English at home  Census figures show Maine has a greater proportion of people speaking French at home than any other state in the nation  a result of Maine s large French Canadian community  who migrated from adjacent Quebec and New Brunswick  5 28  of Maine households

2001  Maine s largest city of Portland surpassed Boston as New England s busiest port  by tonnage   due to its ability to handle large tankers  Maine s Portland International Jetport was recently expanded  providing the state with increased air traffic from carriers such as JetBlue  Maine has very few large companies that maintain headquarters in the state  and fewer than before due to

Maine has a longstanding tradition of being home to many shipbuilding companies  In the 18th and 19th centuries  Maine was home to many shipyards that produced wooden sailing ships  The main function of these ships was to transport either cargoes or passengers overseas  One of these yards was located in Pennellville Historic District in what is now Brunswick  Maine  This yard  owned by the Pennell family  was typical of the many family owned shipbuilding companies of the time period  Other such examples of shipbuilding families were the Skolfields and the Morses  During the 18th and 19th centuries  wooden shipbuilding of this sort made up a sizable portion of the economy   edit  Transportation jetBlue aircraft at the Portland International Jetport   edit  Airports The Portland

Susan Collins  left  and Olympia Snowe  right   In the 1930s  Maine was one of very few states which retained Republican Party sentiments  In the 1936 Presidential election  Franklin D  Roosevelt received the electoral votes of every state other than Maine and Vermont  In the 1960s  Maine began to lean toward the Democrats  especially in Presidential elections  In 1968  Hubert Humphrey became just the second Democrat in half a century to carry Maine  thanks to the presence of his running mate  Maine Senator Edmund Muskie  although the state voted Republican in every Presidential election in the 1970s and 1980s  Maine has since become a left leaning swing state and has voted Democratic in five successive Presidential elections  casting its votes for Bill Clinton twice  Al Gore in 2000  John Kerry  with 53 6  of the vote  in 2004  and Barack Obama in 2008  Although Democrats have carried the state in presidential elections in recent years  Republicans have largely maintained their control of the state s U S  Senate seats  with Ed Muskie  William Hathaway and George Mitchell being the only Maine Democrats serving in the U S  Senate in the past fifty years  In the 2010 midterm elections  Republicans made major gains in Maine  They captured the governor s office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s  Ross Perot achieved a great deal of success in Maine in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996  In 1992 as an independent candidate  Perot came in second to Bill Clinton  despite the longtime presence of the Bush family summer home in Kennebunkport  In 1996  as the nominee of the Reform Party  Perot did better in Maine than in any other state  Since 1969  two of Maine s four electoral votes are awarded based on the winner of the statewide election  The other two go to the highest vote winner in each of the state s two congressional districts  Famous politicians from Maine include Percival Baxter  James Blaine  Owen Brewster  William Cohen  Susan Collins  Hannibal Hamlin  George J  Mitchell  Edmund Muskie  Thomas Brackett Reed  Margaret Chase Smith  Olympia Snowe  and Wallace H  White

Education Main article  Education in Maine  edit  Public schools See also  List of school districts in Maine Public schools are run by one of four types of school districts  1  local for a single school  2  School Union whose members share only a superintendent  3  School Administrative District containing multiple towns and one superintendent  and 4  Community School District that has one elementary school that towns share  Private schools are less common than public schools  A large number of private elementary schools with under 20 students exist  but most private high schools in Maine can be perceived as  semi private   This means that while it costs money to send children there  towns will make a contract with a school to take children from a town or School Administrative District at a slightly reduced rate  Often this is done when it is deemed cheaper to subsidize private tuition than build a whole new school when a private one already exists   edit  Culture  edit
