region of the U S  state of Florida  It is the county seat of Orange County  and the center of the Greater Orlando metropolitan area  According to the 2010 US Census  the city had a population of 238 300  making Orlando the 79th largest city in the United States  The Greater Orlando metropolitan area has a population of 2 134 411  making it the 26th largest metro area in the United States  the sixth largest metro area in the southeastern United States  and the third largest metro area in Florida  Orlando is the fifth largest city in Florida  and the state s largest inland city  Orlando is nicknamed  The City Beautiful  and its symbol is the fountain at Lake Eola  The current mayor is Buddy Dyer  The city is best known for the Walt Disney World Resort  located approximately 21 miles  34 km  southwest of Downtown Orlando in Lake Buena Vista   founded by the Walt Disney Company in 1971  and for the Universal Orlando Resort  which consists of two parks  Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure  as well as other attractions  including City Walk   Orlando is also home to the SeaWorld theme park  Gatorland  as well as Wet  n Wild Water Park  With the exception of Walt

settlers arrived in 1836  Orlando was sparsely populated by the Creek and other Native American tribes  There are very few archaeological sites in the area today  except for the ruins of Fort Gatlin along the shores of modern day Lake Gatlin south of downtown Orlando  There have also been some instances in which construction projects yielded arrowheads or musket bullets  citation needed   edit  Namesakes Prior to being known by its current name  Orlando was known as Jernigan  This originates from the first permanent settler  Aaron Jernigan  a cattleman who acquired land along Lake Holden by the terms of the Armed Occupation Act of 1842  8  City officials and local legend say the name Orlando originated from a soldier named Orlando Reeves who died in 1835 during a supposed attack by Native Americans in the area during the Second Seminole War  Reeves was acting as a sentinel for a company of soldiers that had set up camp for the night on the banks of Sandy Beach Lake  now Lake Eola   9  There are conflicting legends  however  as an in depth reviews of military records in the 1970s and 1980s turned up no record of Orlando Reeves ever existing  9  The legend grew throughout the early 1900s  particularly with local historian Kena Fries  retelling in various writings and on local radio station WDBO in 1929  9  A memorial beside Lake Eola   originally placed by students of Orlando s Cherokee Junior School in 1939 9    designates the spot where the city s supposed namesake fell  Local historians have come up with a more credible version of the  Reeves  story  During the Second Seminole War  the U S  Army established an outpost at Fort Gatlin  a few miles south of the modern downtown  in 1838  but it was quickly abandoned when the war came to an end  Most pioneers did not arrive until after the Third Seminole War in the 1850s  Many early residents made their living by cattle ranching  One such resident was a South Carolinian Orlando Savage Rees  10  Rees owned several large estates in Florida and Mississippi  On two separate occasions  relatives of Rees claimed their ancestor was the namesake of the city  F K  Bull of South Carolina  Rees  great grandson  told an Orlando reporter of a story in 1955  years later  Charles M  Bull Jr  of Orlando  Rees  great great grandson  offered local historians similar information  10  Rees most certainly did exist and was in Florida during that time period  in 1832 John James Audubon met with Rees in his large estate at Spring Garden  about 45 minutes away from Orlando  10  In 1837  Rees also attempted to stop a peace Treaty with the Indians because it did not reimburse him for the loss of slaves and crops  The story goes Rees  sugar farms in the area were burned out in the Seminole attacks in 1835  the year Orlando Reeves supposedly died   Subsequently  he led an expedition to recover stolen slaves and cattle  It is believed he could have left a pine bough marker with his name next to the trail  and later residents misread the sign as  Reeves  and thought it was his grave  10  In the years since the telling of this story  it has merged with the Orlando Reeves story  Some variants attempt to account for Reeves having no military records by using the name of another  Orlando  that exists in some written records   Orlando Acosta  Not much is known about Acosta and if he even existed  In 1975  local historian  and then chairman of the county historical commission  Judge Donald A  Cheney put forth a new version of the story in an Orlando Sentinel article  10  Cheney is the son of Judge John Moses Cheney  a major figure in Orlando s history who arrived in Orlando in 1885  John Cheney knew James Speer   another major figure who proposed the name of Orlando  Cheney s retelling relates how Speer proposed the name Orlando after one of the main characters in the Shakespeare play As You Like It  Speer   was a gentleman of culture and an admirer of William Shakespeare   According to him   Orlando  was a veritable Forest of Arden  the locale of As You Like It   10  One of the main streets in downtown Orlando is named Rosalind Avenue  after Rosalind  the heroine of the play  Speer s descendants have also confirmed this version of the naming and the legend has continued to grow  10  What is known for certain is Jernigan became Orlando in 1857  The move is believed to be sparked  in part  by Aaron Jernigan s fall from grace after he was relieved of his military command by military officials in 1856  His behavior was so notorious that Secretary of War Jefferson Davis wrote   It is said they  Jernigan s militia  are more dreadful than the Indians   10  At a meeting in 1857  debate had grown concerning the name of the town  Pioneer William B  Hull recalled how Speer rose in the heat of the argument and said   This place is often spoken of as  Orlando s Grave   Let s drop the word  grave  and let the county set be Orlando   10  Through this retelling of history  it is believed that a marker of some sort was indeed found by Jernigan  or one of the other original pioneers   but  others claim Speer simply used the folk legend to help push for the Shakespearian name   edit  Incorporation After Mosquito County was divided in 1845  Orlando became the county seat of the new Orange County in 1856  It remained a rural backwater during the Civil War  and suffered greatly during the Union blockade  The Reconstruction Era brought on a population explosion  which led to Orlando s incorporation as a town on July 31  1875  and as a city in 1885  11  The period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando s Golden Era  when it became the hub of Florida s citrus industry  But the Great Freeze of 1894 95 forced many owners to give up their independent groves  thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few  citrus barons  who shifted operations south  primarily around Lake Wales in Polk County  citation needed  The Wyoming Hotel c  1905 Notable homesteaders in the area included the Curry family  Through their property in east Orlando flowed the Econlockhatchee River  which travelers crossed by fording  This would be commemorated by the street s name  Curry Ford Road  Also  just south of the airport in the Boggy Creek area was 150 acres  0 61 km2  of property homesteaded in the late 19th century by the Ward family  This property is still owned by the Ward family  and can be seen from flights out of MCO southbound immediately on the south side of SR 417   edit  After Industrial Revolution This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Orlando  as Florida s largest inland city  became a popular resort during the years between the Spanish American War and World War I  In the 1920s  Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the Florida Land Boom  Land prices soared  During this period several neighborhoods in downtown were constructed  endowing it with many bungalows  The boom ended when several hurricanes hit Florida in the late 1920s  along with the Great Depression  During World War II  a number of Army personnel were stationed at the Orlando Army Air Base and nearby Pinecastle Army Air Field  Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families  In 1956 the aerospace and defense company Martin Marietta  now Lockheed Martin  established a plant in the city  Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the United States Air Force in 1947 when it became a separate service and were re designated as air force bases  AFB   In 1958  Pinecastle AFB was renamed McCoy Air Force Base after Colonel Michael N W  McCoy  a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation  killed in the crash of a B 47 Stratojet bomber north of Orlando  In the 1960s  the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the Strategic Air Command  SAC   operating B 52 Stratofortress and KC 135 Stratotanker aircraft  in addition to detachment operations by EC 121 and U 2 aircraft  Lucerne Circle c  1905  edit  Tourism in history Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando s economy occurred in 1965 when Walt Disney announced plans to build Walt Disney World  Although Disney had considered the regions of Miami and Tampa for his park  one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to hurricanes   Orlando s inland location  although not free from hurricane damage  exposed it to less threat than coastal regions  The vacation resort opened in October 1971  ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area  which now encompasses Orange  Seminole  Osceola  and Lake counties  As a result  tourism became the centerpiece of the area s economy  Orlando now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world  citation needed  Another major factor in Orlando s growth occurred in 1962  when the new Orlando Jetport  the precursor of the present day Orlando International Airport  was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base  By 1970  four major airlines  Delta Air Lines  National Airlines  Eastern Airlines and Southern Airways  were providing scheduled flights  McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in 1975  and most of it is now part of the airport  The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code  MCO    edit  Present day View of Downtown Orlando  center  and periphery to Lake Apopka  upper right   January 2011 Today  the historic core of  Old Orlando  resides in Downtown Orlando along Church Street  between Orange Avenue and Garland Avenue  Urban development and the Central Business District of downtown have rapidly shaped the downtown skyline during recent history  The present day historic district is primarily associated with the neighborhoods around Lake Eola where century old oaks line brick streets  These neighborhoods  known as  Lake Eola Heights  and  Thornton Park   contain some of the oldest homes in Orlando   edit  Geography and cityscape Lake Eola in 1911 The geography of Orlando is mostly wetlands  consisting of many lakes and swamps  The terrain is generally flat  making the land fairly low and wet  citation needed  The area is dotted with hundreds of lakes  the largest of which is Lake Apopka  Central Florida s bedrock is mostly limestone and very porous  the Orlando area is susceptible to sinkholes  Probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in Winter Park  a city immediately north of downtown Orlando  dubbed   The Winter Park Sinkhole   There are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits of Orlando and many unincorporated communities  Orlando s city limits resemble a checkerboard  with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits  Such an arrangement can be cumbersome citation needed  as some areas are served by both Orange County and the City of Orlando  This also explains Orlando s relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population  The city and county are currently working together in an effort to  round out  the city limits with Orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the current city limits  12   edit  Climate Orlando s climate is transitional  with many characteristics of a tropical climate  but is situated on the southern fringe of the humid subtropical climate zone  K ppen climate classification Cfa  There are two major seasons each year  One is hot and rainy  lasting from June until late September  roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season   The other is the dry  warm season  October through May  bringing less frequent rainfall  yet still with warm temperatures  citation needed  The area s warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation  its position relatively close to the Tropic of Cancer  and its location in the center of a peninsula  Many characteristics of its climate are a result of its proximity to the Gulf Stream  which flows around the peninsula of Florida  During the height of Orlando s humid summer season  temperatures rarely fall below 70  F  21  C   and daytime highs average in the 90s  32 37  C   citation needed  The area s humidity acts as a buffer  usually preventing actual temperatures from exceeding 100  F  38  C   but also pushing the heat index to over 110  F  43  C   The city s highest recorded temperature is 101  F  38  C   set July 2  1998  During these months  strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily  These storms are caused by air masses from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida  They are highlighted by spectacular lightning and can also bring heavy rain  sometimes several inches per hour  and powerful winds as well as occasional damaging hail  citation needed  During the cooler seasons  humidity is lower and temperatures are more moderate  and can fluctuate more readily  Average daytime highs in January are about 72  F  22  C   and average nighttime lows are around 50  F  10  C   Temperatures dip below 32  F  0  C  on an average of two nights per annum  citation needed  and the lowest recorded temperature is 19  F   7  C   set on January 21  1985  Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts  and their accompanying precipitation  have passed  snow is exceptionally rare  The only accumulation ever to occur in the city proper since recordkeeping began was in 1948  though surrounding areas did accumulate 6  in a snow event in 1977  It is also likely that accumulations occurred in connection with the Great Blizzard of 1899  Trace flurries have also been observed in 1989 and 2010  citation needed  The average annual rainfall in Orlando is 48 35 inches  122 8 cm   most of it occurring in the period from June to September  The months of October through May are Orlando s driest season  During this period  especially in its later months   there is often a wildfire hazard  During some years  fires have been severe  In 1998  a strong El Ni o caused an unusually wet January and February  followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer  causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air quality alerts in Orlando and severely impacted normal daily life  including the postponement of that year s Pepsi 400 NASCAR race in nearby Daytona Beach  citation needed  Orlando is a major population center and has a considerable hurricane risk  although it is not as high as in South Florida s urban corridor or other coastal regions  Since the city is located 42 miles  68 km  inland from the Atlantic and 77 miles  124 km  inland from the Gulf of Mexico  13  hurricanes usually weaken before arriving  Storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 feet  30 m  above sea level  Despite its location  the city does see strong hurricanes  During the notorious 2004 hurricane season  Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage  with Hurricane Charley the worst of these  The city also experienced widespread damage during Hurricane Donna in 1960  citation needed  Tornadoes are not usually connected with the strong thunderstorms of the summer  They are more common during the infrequent storms of winter  as well as in passing hurricanes  The two worst major outbreaks in the area s history  a 1998 outbreak that killed 42 people and a 2007 outbreak that killed 21  both happened in February  Over the course of a typical year  there are 89 clear days  147 partly cloudy days  and 132 cloudy days  citation needed  Orlando Climate chart  explanation  J F M A M J J A S O N D     2 4   71 49     2 4   74 52     3 8   78 56     2 6   83 60     3 5   88 66     7 6   91 72     7

 federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of SunRail  a local commuter rail service  to operate on the CSX A line tracks between DeLand and Poinciana  passing through the downtown

communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties  The federal and state funds would have covered approximately 80  of the estimated  400 million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route  The counties involved had approved local matching funds in 2007 and the line was projected to begin operations in 2011  44  However  the project was ultimately voted down by Florida
