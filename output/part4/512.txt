World War I  WWI   which was predominantly called the World War or the Great War from its occurrence until 1939  and the First World War or World War I thereafter  was a major war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918  It involved all the world s great powers  5  which were assembled in two opposing alliances  the Allies  based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom  France and Russia  and the Central Powers  originally centred around the Triple Alliance of Germany  Austria Hungary and Italy  but  as Austria Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement  Italy did not enter into the war   6  These alliances both reorganised  Italy fought for the Allies   and expanded as more nations entered the war  Ultimately more than 70 million military personnel  including 60 million Europeans  were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history  7  8  More than 9 million combatants were killed  largely because of great technological advances in firepower without corresponding advances in mobility  It was the sixth deadliest conflict in world history  subsequently paving the way for various political changes such as revolutions in the nations involved  9  Long term causes of the war included the imperialistic foreign policies of the great powers of Europe  including the German Empire  the Austro Hungarian Empire  the Ottoman Empire  the Russian Empire  the British Empire  the French Republic  and Italy  The assassination on 28 June 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria  the heir to the throne of Austria Hungary  by a Yugoslav nationalist was the proximate trigger of the war  It resulted in a Habsburg ultimatum against the Kingdom of Serbia  10  11  Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked  so within weeks the major powers were at war  via their colonies  the conflict soon spread around the world  On 28 July  the conflict opened with the Austro Hungarian invasion of Serbia  12  13  followed by the German invasion of Belgium  Luxembourg and France  and a Russian attack against Germany  After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt  the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917  In the East  the Russian army successfully fought against the Austro Hungarian forces but was forced back by the German army  Additional fronts opened after the Ottoman Empire joined the war in 1914  Italy and Bulgaria in 1915 and Romania in 1916  The Russian Empire collapsed in March 1917  and Russia left the war after the October Revolution later that year  After a 1918 German offensive along the western front  United States forces entered the trenches and the Allies drove back the German armies in a series of successful offensives  Germany  which had its own trouble with revolutionaries at this point  agreed to a cease fire on 11 November 1918  later known as Armistice Day  The war had ended in victory for the Allies  Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts  as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war  By the end of the war  four major imperial powers  the German  Russian  Austro Hungarian and Ottoman empires  ceased to exist  The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory  while the latter two were dismantled entirely  The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states  14  The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict  The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires  the repercussions of Germany s defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are generally agreed to be factors contributing to

often called the World War and the Great War  in English speaking countries  After the onset of the Second World War in 1939  the terms World War I or the First World War became standard  with British and Canadian historians favouring the First World War  and Americans World War I  The notion that the  World War  was merely the first in a series was not a new idea at the time  however  it was first introduced in September 1914 by German philosopher Ernst Haeckel  who claimed that  there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared  European War      will become the first world war in the full sense of the word   17 The First World War was the title of a 1920 history by the officer and journalist Charles   Court Repington  Background Main article  Causes of World War I Map of the participants in World War I  Allied Powers in green  Central Powers in orange  and neutral countries in grey In the 19th century  the major European powers had gone to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe  resulting by 1900 in a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent  6  These had started in 1815  with the Holy Alliance between Prussia  Russia  and Austria  Then  in October 1873  German Chancellor Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  German  Dreikaiserbund  between the monarchs of Austria Hungary  Russia and Germany  This agreement failed because Austria Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy  leaving Germany and Austria Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879  called the Dual Alliance  This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken  6  In 1882  this alliance was expanded to include Italy in what became the Triple Alliance  18  After 1870  European conflict was averted largely through a carefully planned network of treaties between the German Empire and the remainder of Europe orchestrated by Bismarck  He especially worked to hold Russia at Germany s side to avoid a two front war with France and Russia  When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor  Kaiser   Bismarck s alliances were gradually de emphasised  For example  the Kaiser refused to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1890  Two years later  the Franco Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance  In 1904  the United Kingdom sealed an alliance with France  the Entente Cordiale  and in 1907  the United Kingdom and Russia signed the Anglo Russian Convention  This system of interlocking bilateral agreements formed the Triple Entente  6  HMS Dreadnought  A naval arms race existed between the United Kingdom and Germany  German industrial and economic power had grown greatly after unification and the foundation of the Empire in 1870  From the mid 1890s on  the government of Wilhelm II used this base to devote significant economic resources to building up the Kaiserliche Marine  Imperial German Navy   established by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz  in rivalry with the British Royal Navy for world naval supremacy  19  As a result  each nation strove to out build the other in terms of capital ships  With the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906  the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over its German rival  19  The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe  with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to producing the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan European conflict  20  Between 1908 and 1913  the military spending of the European powers increased by 50 percent  21  Gavrilo Princip  a Bosnian Serb student  was arrested immediately after he assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria Austria Hungary precipitated the Bosnian crisis of 1908 1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina  which it had occupied since 1878  This angered the Kingdom of Serbia and its patron  the Pan Slavic and Orthodox Russian Empire  22  Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in what was known as  the powder keg of Europe   22  Ethno linguistic map of Austria Hungary  1910 In 1912 and 1913 the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire  The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire  creating an independent Albanian State while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria  Serbia  Montenegro  and Greece  When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913  it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33 day Second Balkan War  further destabilising the region  23  On 28 June 1914  Gavrilo Princip  a Bosnian Serb student and member of Young Bosnia  assassinated the heir to the Austro Hungarian throne  Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo  Bosnia  24  This began a period of diplomatic manoeuvring among Austria Hungary  Germany  Russia  France  and Britain called the July Crisis  Wanting to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia  Austria Hungary delivered the July Ultimatum to Serbia  a series of ten demands intentionally made unacceptable  intending to provoke a war with Serbia  25  When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands  Austria Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914  Strachan argues   Whether an equivocal and early response by Serbia would have made any difference to Austria Hungary s behaviour must be doubtful  Franz Ferdinand was not the sort of personality who commanded popularity  and his demise did not cast the empire into deepest mourning   26  The Russian Empire  unwilling to allow Austria Hungary to eliminate its influence in the Balkans  and in support of its longtime Serb prot g s  ordered a partial mobilisation one day later  18  When the German Empire began to mobilise on 30 July 1914  France  resentful of the German conquest of Alsace Lorraine during the Franco Prussian War  ordered French mobilisation on 1 August  Germany declared war on Russia on the same day  27  The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914  following an  unsatisfactory reply  to the British ultimatum that Belgium must be kept neutral  28  Theatres of Conflict Opening hostilities Confusion among the Central Powers The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication  Germany had promised to support Austria Hungary s invasion of Serbia  but interpretations of what this meant differed  Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914  but the replacements had never been tested in exercises  Austro Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia  29  Germany  however  envisioned Austria Hungary directing most of its troops against Russia  while Germany dealt with France  This confusion forced the Austro Hungarian Army to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts  On 9 September 1914  the Septemberprogramm  a possible plan which detailed Germany s specific war aims and the conditions that Germany sought to force on the Allied Powers  was outlined by German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg  It was never officially adopted  African campaigns Lettow surrendering his forces to the British at Abercorn Main article  African theatre of World War I Some of the first clashes of the war involved British  French  and German colonial forces in Africa  On 7 August  French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of Togoland  On 10 August  German forces in South West Africa attacked South Africa  sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war  The German colonial forces in German East Africa  led by Colonel Paul Emil von Lettow Vorbeck  fought a guerrilla warfare campaign during World War I and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe  30  Serbian campaign Declaration of war  Austro Hungarian government s telegram to the government of Serbia on 28 July 1914  Serbian troops artillery positions in the Battle of Kolubara  Main article  Serbian Campaign  World War I  Austria invaded and fought the Serbian army at the Battle of Cer and Battle of Kolubara beginning on 12 August  Over the next two weeks Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses  which marked the first major Allied victories of the war and dashed Austro Hungarian hopes of a swift victory  As a result  Austria had to keep sizable forces on the Serbian front  weakening its efforts against Russia  31  Serbia s defeat of the Austro Hungarian invasion of 1914 counts among the major upset victories of the last century  32  German forces in Belgium and France German soldiers in a railway goods van on the way to the front in 1914  A message on the car spells out  Trip to Paris   early in the war all sides expected the conflict to be a short one  Main article  Western Front  World War I  At the outbreak of the First World War  the German army  consisting in the West of seven field armies  carried out a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan  designed to quickly attack France through neutral Belgium before turning southwards to encircle the French army on the German border  10  The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to converge on Paris  and initially the Germans were successful  particularly in the Battle of the Frontiers  14 24 August   By 12 September  the French  with assistance from the British forces  halted the German advance east of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne  5 12 September   The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west  10  The French offensive into Germany  launched on 7 August with the Battle of Mulhouse  had limited success  In the east  only one field army defended East Prussia  and when Russia attacked in this region it diverted German forces intended for the Western Front  Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the First Battle of Tannenberg  17 August   2 September   but this diversion aggravated problems of insufficient speed of advance from rail heads not foreseen by the German General Staff  The Central Powers were denied a quick victory and forced to fight a war on two fronts  The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230 000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself  Despite this  communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of early victory  33  Asia and the Pacific Main article  Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I New Zealand

Allied forces had seized all the German territories in the Pacific  only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea remained  34  35  Early stages Trench warfare begins Main article  Western Front  World War I  Sir Winston Churchill with the Royal Scots Fusiliers  1916 Sunlight Soap ad  placed in a trench  1915  Military tactics before World War I had failed to keep pace with advances in technology  These advances allowed for impressive defence systems  which out of date military tactics could not break through for most of the war  Barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances  Artillery  vastly more lethal than in the 1870s  coupled with machine guns  made crossing open ground extremely difficult  36  The Germans introduced poison gas  it soon became used by both sides  though it never proved decisive in winning a battle  Its effects were brutal  causing slow and painful death  and poison gas became one of the most feared and best remembered horrors of the war  Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties  In time  however  technology began to produce new offensive weapons  such as the tank  37  Britain and France were its primary users  the Germans employed captured Allied tanks and small numbers of their own design  After the First Battle of the Marne  both Entente and German forces began a series of outflanking manoeuvres  in the so called  Race to the Sea   Britain and France soon found themselves facing entrenched German forces from Lorraine to Belgium s coast  10  Britain and France sought to take the offensive  while Germany defended the occupied territories  consequently  German trenches were much better constructed than those of their enemy  Anglo French trenches were only intended to be  temporary  before their forces broke through German defences  38  Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances  On 22 April 1915 at the Second Battle of Ypres  the Germans  violating the Hague Convention  used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front  Algerian troops retreated when gassed and a six kilometre  four mile  hole opened in the Allied lines that the Germans quickly exploited  taking Kitcheners  Wood  Canadian soldiers closed the breach at the Second

communications trench on the first day on the Somme  1 July 1916  On 1 July 1916  the British Army endured the bloodiest day in its history  suffering 57 470 casualties  including 19 240 dead  on the first day of the Battle of the Somme  Most of the casualties occurred in the first hour of the attack  The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army almost half a million men  40  Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years  though protracted German action at Verdun throughout 1916  41  combined with the bloodletting at the Somme  brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse  Futile attempts at frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French poilu  infantry  and led to widespread mutinies  especially during the Nivelle Offensive  42  Canadian troops advancing behind a British Mark II tank at the Battle of Vimy Ridge  A French assault on German positions  Champagne  France  1917  Officers and senior enlisted

sea Throughout 1915 17  the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany  because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides  Strategically  while the Germans only mounted a single main offensive at Verdun  the Allies made several attempts to break through German lines  Tactically  German commander Erich Ludendorff s doctrine of  elastic defence  was well suited for trench warfare  This defence had a lightly defended forward position and a more powerful main position farther back beyond artillery range  from which an immediate and powerful counter offensive could be launched  43  44  Ludendorff wrote on the fighting in 1917  The 25th of August concluded the second phase of the Flanders battle  It had cost us heavily     The costly August battles in Flanders and at Verdun imposed a heavy strain on the Western troops  In spite of all the concrete protection they seemed more or less powerless under the enormous weight of the enemy s artillery  At some points they no longer displayed the firmness which I  in common with the local commanders  had hoped for  The enemy managed to adapt himself to our method of employing counter attacks     I myself was being put to a terrible strain  The state of affairs in the West appeared to prevent the execution of our plans elsewhere  Our wastage had been so high as to cause grave misgivings  and had exceeded all expectation  45  On the battle of the Menin Road Ridge  Ludendorff wrote  Another terrific assault was made on our lines on the 20 September     The enemy s onslaught on the 20th was successful  which proved the superiority of the attack over the defence  Its strength did not consist in the tanks  we found them inconvenient  but put them out of action all the same  The power of the attack lay in the artillery  and in the fact that ours did not do enough damage to the hostile infantry as they were assembling  and above all  at the actual time of the assault  46  Around 1 1 to 1 2 million soldiers from the British and Dominion armies were on the Western Front at any one time  47  A thousand battalions  occupying sectors of the line from the North Sea to the Orne River  operated on a month long four stage rotation system  unless an offensive was underway  The front contained over 9 600 kilometres  5 965 mi  of trenches  Each battalion held its sector for about a week before moving back to support lines and then further back to the reserve lines before a week out of line  often in the Poperinge or Amiens areas  In the 1917 Battle of Arras  the only significant British military success was the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps under Sir Arthur Currie and Julian Byng  The assaulting troops could  for the first time  overrun  rapidly reinforce and hold the ridge defending the coal rich Douai plain  48  49  Naval war Main article  Naval warfare of World War I At the start of the war  the German Empire had cruisers scattered across the globe  some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping  The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down  though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping  For example  the German detached light cruiser SMS Emden  part of the East Asia squadron stationed at Tsingtao  seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen  as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer  However  most of the German East Asia squadron consisting of the armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau  light cruisers N rnberg and Leipzig and two transport ships did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it met British warships  The German flotilla and Dresden sank two armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel  but was almost destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914  with only Dresden and a few auxiliaries escaping  but at the Battle of M s a Tierra these too were destroyed or interned  50  Soon after the outbreak of hostilities  Britain began a naval blockade of Germany  The strategy proved effective  cutting off vital military and civilian supplies  although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries  51  Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean  causing danger to even neutral ships  52  Since there was limited response to this tactic  Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare  53  The 1916 Battle of Jutland  German  Skagerrakschlacht  or  Battle of the Skagerrak   developed into the largest naval battle of the war  the only full scale clash of battleships during the war  and one of the largest in history  It took place on 31 May   1 June 1916  in the North Sea off Jutland  The Kaiserliche Marine s High Seas Fleet  commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer  squared off against the Royal Navy s Grand Fleet  led by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe  The engagement was a stand off  as the Germans  outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet  managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received  Strategically  however  the British asserted their control of the sea  and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war  54  German U boats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain  55  The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning  giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival  55  56  The United States launched a protest  and Germany changed its rules of engagement  After the notorious sinking of the passenger ship RMS Lusitania in 1915  Germany promised not to target passenger liners  while Britain armed its merchant ships  placing them beyond the protection of the  cruiser rules  which demanded warning and placing crews in  a place of safety   a standard which lifeboats did not meet   57  Finally  in early 1917 Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare  realising the Americans would eventually enter the war  55  58  Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the U S  could transport a large army overseas  but could maintain only five long range U boats on station  to limited effect  55  U 155 exhibited near Tower Bridge in London after the First World War  The U boat threat lessened in 1917  when merchant ships began travelling in convoys  escorted by destroyers  This tactic made it difficult for U boats to find targets  which significantly lessened losses  after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced  accompanying destroyers might attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success  Convoys slowed the flow of supplies  since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled  The solution to the delays was an extensive program to build new freighters  Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys  59  The U boats had sunk more than 5 000 Allied ships  at a cost of 199 submarines  60  World War I also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat  with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a successful raid against the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in July 1918  as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol  61  Southern theatres War in the Balkans Main articles  Balkans Campaign  World War I   Serbian Campaign  World War I   and Macedonian front  World War I  Faced with Russia  Austria Hungary could spare only one third of its army to attack Serbia  After suffering heavy losses  the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital  Belgrade  A Serbian counter attack in the battle of Kolubara  however  succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914  For the first ten months of 1915  Austria Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy  German and Austro Hungarian diplomats  however  scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join in attacking Serbia  The Austro Hungarian provinces of Slovenia  Croatia and Bosnia provided troops for Austria Hungary  invading Serbia as well as fighting Russia and Italy  Montenegro allied itself with Serbia  62  Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month  as the Central Powers  now including Bulgaria  sent in 600 000 troops  The Serbian army  fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat  retreated into Albania  The Serbs suffered defeat in the Battle of Kosovo  Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the Battle of Mojkovac in 6 7 January 1916  but ultimately the Austrians conquered Montenegro  too  The surving 70 000 Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece  63  In late 1915  a Franco British force landed at Salonica in Greece  to offer assistance and to pressure the government to declare war against the Central Powers  Unfortunately for the Allies  the pro German King Constantine I dismissed the pro Allied government of Eleftherios Venizelos  before the Allied expeditionary force could arrive  64  The friction between the king of Greece and the Allies continued to accumulate with the National Schism  which effectively divided Greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of Venizelos in Salonica  After intensive diplomatic negotiations and an armed confrontation in Athens between Allied and royalist forces  an incident known as Noemvriana  the king of Greece resigned  and his second son Alexander took his place  Venizelos returned to Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece  now unified  officially joined the war on the side of the Allies  The entire Greek army was mobilized and began to participate in military operations against the Central Powers on the Macedonian front  Bulgarian soldiers in a trench  preparing to fire against an incoming airplane After conquest  Serbia was divided between Austro Hungary and Bulgaria  In 1917 the Serbs launched the Toplica Uprising and liberated for a short time the area between the Kopaonik mountains and the South Morava river  The uprising was crushed by joint efforts of Bulgarian and Austrian forces at the end of March 1917  The Macedonian Front in the beginning was mostly static  French and Serbian forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing Bitola on 19 November 1916 as a result of the costly Monastir Offensive which brought stabilization of the front  Serbian and French troops finally made breakthrough  after most of the German and Austro Hungarian troops had withdrawn This breakthrough was significant in defeating Bulgaria and Austro Hungary  which leaded to the final victory of WWI  The Bulgarians suffered their only defeat of the war at the Battle of Dobro Pole but days later  they decisively defeated British and Greek forces at the Battle of Doiran  avoiding occupation  After Serbian breakthrough of Bulgarian lines  Bulgaria capitulated on 29 September 1918  65  Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and a day after the Bulgarian collapse  during a meeting with government officials  insisted on an immediate peace settlement  66  The disappearance of the Macedonian front meant that the road to Budapest and Vienna was now opened for the 670 000 strong army of general Franchet d Esperey as the Bulgarian surrender deprived the Central Powers of the 278 infantry battalions and 1 500 guns  the equivalent of some 25 to 30 German divisions  that were previously holding the line  67  The German high command responded by sending only seven infantry and one cavalry division but these forces were far from enough for a front to be reestablished  67  Ottoman Empire Main article  Middle Eastern theatre of World War I The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in the war  the secret Ottoman German Alliance having been signed in August 1914  68  It threatened Russia s Caucasian territories and Britain s communications with India via the Suez Canal  The British and French opened overseas fronts with the Gallipoli  1915  and Mesopotamian campaigns  In Gallipoli  the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British  French  and Australian and New Zealand Army Corps  ANZACs   In Mesopotamia  by contrast  after the disastrous Siege of Kut  1915 16   British Imperial forces reorganised and captured Baghdad in March 1917  A British artillery battery emplaced on Mount Scopus in the Battle of Jerusalem  Further to the west  the Suez Canal was successfully defended from Ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916  in August a joint German and Ottoman force was defeated at the Battle of Romani by the Anzac Mounted and the 52nd  Lowland  Infantry Divisions  Following this victory  a British Empire Egyptian Expeditionary Force advanced across the Sinai Peninsula  pushing Ottoman forces back in the Battle of Magdhaba in December and the Battle of Rafa on the border between the Egyptian Sinai and Ottoman Palestine in January 1917  In March and April at the First and Second Battles of Gaza  German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance  but at the end of October the Sinai and Palestine Campaign resumed  when Allenby s XXth Corps  XX1st Corps and Desert Mounted Corps won the Battle of Beersheba  Two Ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the Battle of Mughar Ridge  and early in December Jerusalem was captured following another Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Jerusalem  1917   About this time Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the Eighth Army s commander  replaced by Djevad Pasha  and a few months later the commander of the Ottoman Army in Palestine  Erich von Falkenhayn  was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders  A reorganised Egyptian Expeditionary Force  with an additional mounted division under Field Marshal Edmund Allenby  broke Ottoman forces at the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918  In six weeks  during virtually continuous operations  battles were successfully fought by British infantry and Australian  British  Indian and New Zealand  Light Horse  mounted Yeomanry  Lancers and Mounted Rifle brigades  They campaigned across the Jordan River to Amman in the east and northwards to capture Nablus and Tulkarm in the Judean Hills  and followed the Mediterranean coast into the Jezreel Valley  Esdraelon Plain   where Afula  Jenin and Nazareth were captured  along with Daraa east of the Jordan River on the Hejaz railway  Semakh and Tiberias on the Sea of Gallilee  were captured on the way northwards to Damascus and Aleppo  The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October  when two and a half Ottoman armies had been defeated and captured  Russian forest trench at the Battle of Sarikamish Russian armies generally had the best of it in the Caucasus  Enver Pasha  supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces  was ambitious and dreamed of re conquering central Asia and areas that had been lost to Russia previously  He was  however  a poor commander  69  He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100 000 troops  insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter  he lost 86  of his force at the Battle of Sarikamish  70  General Yudenich  the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916  drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories  70  In 1917  Russian Grand Duke Nicholas assumed command of the Caucasus front  Nicholas planned a railway from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories  so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917  However  in March 1917  February in the pre revolutionary Russian calendar   the Czar was overthrown in the February Revolution and the Russian Caucasus Army began to fall apart  German soldiers in Jerusalem Instigated by the Arab bureau of the British Foreign Office  the Arab Revolt started with the help of Britain in June 1916 at the Battle of Mecca  led by Sherif Hussein of Mecca  and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus  Fakhri Pasha  the Ottoman commander of Medina  resisted for more than two and half years during the Siege of Medina  71  Along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt  the Senussi tribe  incited and armed by the Turks  waged a small scale guerrilla war against Allied troops  The British were forced to dispatch 12 000 troops to oppose them in the Senussi Campaign  Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid 1916  72  Italian participation Main article  Italian Campaign  World War I  Further information  Battles of the Isonzo Austro Hungarian mountain corps in Tyrol Italy had been allied with the German and Austro Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the Triple Alliance  However  the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in Trentino  Istria  and Dalmatia  Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France  effectively nullifying its alliance  73  At the start of hostilities  Italy refused to commit troops  arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive and that Austria Hungary was an aggressor  The Austro Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality  offering the French colony of Tunisia in return  The Allies made a counter offer in which Italy would receive the Southern Tyrol  Julian March and territory on the Dalmatian coast after the defeat of Austria Hungary  This was formalised by the Treaty of London  Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915  Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria Hungary on 23 May  Fifteen months later Italy declared war on Germany  Militarily  the Italians had numerical superiority  This advantage  however  was lost  not only because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place  but also because of the strategies and tactics employed  Field Marshal Luigi Cadorna  a staunch proponent of the frontal assault  had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau  taking Ljubljana and threatening Vienna  Cadorna s plan did not take into account the difficulties of the rugged Alpine terrain  or the technological changes that created trench warfare  giving rise to a series of bloody and inconclusive stalemated offensives  Depiction of the Battle of Doberd   fought in August 1916 between the Italian and Austro Hungarian army  On the Trentino front  the Austro Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain  which favoured the defender  After an initial strategic retreat  the front remained largely unchanged  while Austrian Kaisersch tzen and Standsch tzen engaged Italian Alpini in bitter hand to hand combat throughout the summer  The Austro Hungarians counterattacked in the Altopiano of Asiago  towards Verona and Padua  in the spring of 1916  Strafexpedition   but made little progress  Beginning in 1915  the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the Isonzo front along the Isonzo River  northeast of Trieste  All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro Hungarians  who held the higher ground  In the summer of 1916  the Italians captured the town of Gorizia  After this minor victory  the front remained static for over a year  despite several Italian offensives  In the autumn of 1917  thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front  the Austro Hungarian troops received large numbers of reinforcements  including German Stormtroopers and the elite Alpenkorps  The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917  spearheaded by the Germans  They achieved a victory at Caporetto  The Italian Army was routed and retreated more than 100 kilometres  62 mi  to reorganise  stabilising the front at the Piave River  Since in the Battle of Caporetto the Italian Army had heavy losses  the Italian Government called to arms the so called  99 Boys  Ragazzi del  99   that is  all males who were 18 years old  In 1918  the Austro Hungarians failed to break through  in a series of battles on the Piave River  and were finally decisively defeated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto in October of that year  From 5 6 November 1918  Italian forces were reported to have reached Lissa  Lagosta  Sebenico  and other localities on the Dalmatian coast  74  By the end of hostilities in November 1918  the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact  75  In 1918  Admiral Enrico Millo declared himself Italy s Governor of Dalmatia  75  Austria Hungary surrendered in early November 1918  76  77  Romanian participation Main article  Romania during World War I Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops Romania had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882  When the war began  however  it declared its neutrality  arguing that because Austria Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia  Romania was under no obligation to join the war  When the Entente Powers promised Romania large territories of eastern Hungary  Transylvania and Banat  that had a large Romanian population in exchange for Romania s declaring war on the Central Powers  the Romanian government renounced its neutrality  and on 27 August 1916 the Romanian Army launched an attack against Austria Hungary  with limited Russian support  The Romanian offensive was initially successful  pushing back the Austro Hungarian troops in Transylvania  but a counterattack by the forces of the Central Powers drove back the Russo Romanian forces  As a result of the Battle of Bucharest the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916  Fighting in Moldova continued in 1917  resulting in a costly stalemate for the Central Powers  78  79  Russian withdrawal from the war in late 1917 as a result of the October Revolution meant that Romania was forced to sign an armistice with the Central Powers on 9 December 1917  In January 1918  Romanian forces established control over Bessarabia as the Russian Army abandoned the province  Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and the Bolshevik Russian government following talks from 5 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months  on 27 March 1918 Romania attached Bessarabia to its territory  formally based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of the territory on the unification with Romania  Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918  Under that treaty  Romania was obliged to end war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria Hungary  ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains  and grant oil concessions to Germany  In exchange  the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia  The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government  and Romania nominally re entered the war on 10 November 1918  The next day  the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compi gne  80  81  Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918  military and civilian  within contemporary borders  were estimated at 748 000  82  The role of India Further information  Third Anglo Afghan War and Hindu German Conspiracy Contrary to British fears of a revolt in India  the outbreak of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and good will towards the United Kingdom  83  84  Indian political leaders from the Indian National Congress and other groups were eager to support the British war effort since they believed that strong support for the war effort would further the cause of Indian Home Rule  The Indian Army in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war  about 1 3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe  Africa  and the Middle East  while both the central government and the princely states sent large supplies of food  money  and ammunition  In all  140 000 men served on the Western Front and nearly 700 000 in the Middle East  Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47 746 killed and 65 126 wounded during World War I  85  The suffering engendered by the war as well as the failure of the British government to grant self government to India after the end of hostilities bred disillusionment and fuelled the campaign for full independence that would be led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and others  Russian troops awaiting a German attack Eastern Front Initial actions Main article  Eastern Front  World War I  While the Western Front had reached stalemate  the war continued in East Europe  Initial Russian plans called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian Galicia and German East Prussia  Although Russia s initial advance into Galicia was largely successful  it was driven back from East Prussia by Hindenburg and Ludendorff at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August and September 1914  86  87  Russia s less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded  By the spring of 1915  the Russians had retreated into Galicia  and in May the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland s southern frontiers  88  On 5 August they captured Warsaw and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland  Russian Revolution Main article  Russian Revolution  1917  Further information  North Russia Campaign Vladimir Illyich Lenin Despite the success of the June 1916 Brusilov Offensive in eastern Galicia  89  dissatisfaction with the Russian government s conduct of the war grew  The offensive s success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory  Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily by Romania s entry into the war on 27 August  German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro Hungarian units in Transylvania  and Bucharest fell to the Central Powers on 6 December  Meanwhile  unrest grew in Russia  as the Tsar remained at the front  Empress Alexandra s increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite  Rasputin  at the end of 1916  In March 1917  demonstrations in Petrograd culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak Provisional Government which shared power with the Petrograd Soviet socialists  This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home  The army became increasingly ineffective  88  Russian Cossacks on the front  1915 Signing the Treaty of Brest Litovsk  9 February 1918  are  1  Count Ottokar von Czernin  2  Richard von K hlmann  and 3  Vasil Radoslavov Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in popularity of the Bolshevik Party  led by Vladimir Lenin  which demanded an immediate end to the war  The successful armed uprising by the Bolsheviks of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany  At first the Bolsheviks refused the German terms  but when German troops began marching across the Ukraine unopposed  the new government acceded to the Treaty of Brest Litovsk on 3 March 1918  The treaty ceded vast territories  including Finland  the Baltic provinces  parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers  90  Despite this enormous apparent German success  the manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive and secured relatively little food or other materiel  With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest Litovsk  the Entente no longer existed  The Allied powers led a small scale invasion of Russia  partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources and  to a lesser extent  to support the  Whites   as opposed to the  Reds   in the Russian Civil War  91  Allied troops landed in Arkhangelsk and in Vladivostok  Central Powers proposal for starting peace negotiations On the way to Verdun   They shall not pass  is a phrase which for all time will be associated with the heroic defense of Verdun  In December 1916  after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun and a successful offensive against Romania  the Germans attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies  Soon after  U S  President Woodrow Wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker  asking in a note for both sides to state their demands  Lloyd George s War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies  After initial outrage and much deliberation  they took Wilson s note as a separate effort  signalling that the U S  was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the  submarine outrages   While the Allies debated a response to Wilson s offer  the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of  a direct exchange of views   Learning of the German response  the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January  They sought restoration of damages  the evacuation of occupied territories  reparations for France  Russia and Romania  and a recognition of the principle of nationalities  This included the liberation of Italians  Slavs  Romanians  Czecho Slovaks  and the creation of a  free and united Poland   On the question of security  the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars  complete with sanctions  as a condition of any peace settlement  92  The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer  because Germany did not state any specific proposals  To Wilson  the Entente powers stated that they would not start peace negotiations until the Central powers evacuated all occupied Allied territories and provided indemnities for all damage which had been done  93  1917 1918 French troopers under General Gouraud  with their machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the Marne  driving back the Germans  1918 German film crew recording the action  Developments in 1917 Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war  although their effects were not fully felt until 1918  The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany  In response  in February 1917  the German General Staff convinced Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare  with the goal of starving Britain out of the war  German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600 000 tons  The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict  but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after 5 to 6 months  before American intervention could make an impact  In reality  tonnage sunk rose above 500 000 tons per month from February to July  It peaked at 860 000 tons in April  After July  the newly re introduced convoy system became extremely effective in reducing the U boat threat  Britain was safe from starvation while German industrial output fell  and the United States troops joined the war in large numbers far earlier than Germany had anticipated  On 3 May 1917  during the Nivelle Offensive  the weary French 2nd Colonial Division  veterans of the Battle of Verdun  refused their orders  arriving drunk and without their weapons  Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division  and harsh measures were not immediately implemented  Then  mutinies afflicted an additional 54 French divisions and saw 20 000 men desert  The other Allied forces attacked but sustained tremendous casualties  94  However  appeals to patriotism and duty  as well as mass arrests and trials  encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches  although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action  95 Robert Nivelle was removed from command by 15 May  replaced by General Philippe P tain  who suspended bloody large scale attacks  Haut Rhin  France  1917 The victory of Austria Hungary and Germany at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies at the Rapallo Conference to form the Supreme War Council to coordinate planning  Previously  British and French armies had operated under separate commands  In December  the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia  This released large numbers of German troops for use in the west  With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in  the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front  The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war  but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive  Furthermore  the leaders of the Central Powers and the Allies became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe  Thus  both sides urgently sought a decisive victory  96  Entry of the United States Main article  American entry into World War I Non intervention At the outbreak of the war the United States pursued a policy of non intervention  avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace  When a German U boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915  with 128 Americans killed  President Woodrow Wilson insisted that  America is too proud to fight  but demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships  Germany complied  Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement  However  he also repeatedly warned that the U S A  would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare  in violation of international law  Former president Theodore Roosevelt  who denounced German acts as  piracy   97  Wilson was narrowly reelected in 1916 as his supporters emphasized  he kept us out of war   In January 1917  Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare  realizing it would mean American entry  The German Foreign Minister  in the Zimmermann Telegram  invited Mexico to join the war as Germany s ally against the United States  In return  the Germans would finance Mexico s war and help it recover the territories of Texas  New Mexico  and Arizona  98  Wilson released the Zimmerman note to the public  and Americans saw it as casus belli a cause for war  Wilson called on antiwar elements to end all wars  by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe  He argued that the war was so important that the U S  had to have a voice in the peace conference  99  President Wilson before Congress  announcing the break in official relations with Germany on 3 February 1917  U S

Grand Fleet  destroyers to Queenstown  Ireland  and submarines to help guard convoys  Several regiments of U S  Marines were also dispatched to France  The British and French wanted U S  units used to

of separate peace In 1917  Emperor Charles I of Austria secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau  with his wife s brother Sixtus in Belgium as an intermediary  without the knowledge of Germany  When the negotiations failed  his attempt was revealed to Germany  resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe  105  106  German Spring Offensive of 1918 Main article  Spring Offensive German General Erich Ludendorff drew up plans  codenamed Operation Michael  for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front  The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances  The German leadership hoped to strike a decisive blow before significant U S  forces arrived  The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near Amiens  German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres  37 mi   107  British and French trenches were penetrated using novel infiltration tactics  also named Hutier tactics  after General Oskar von Hutier  Previously  attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults  However  in the Spring Offensive of 1918  Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points  They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance  More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions  German success relied greatly on the element of surprise  108  The front moved to within 120 kilometres  75 mi  of Paris  Three heavy Krupp railway guns fired 183 shells on the capital  causing many Parisians to flee  The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a national holiday  Many Germans thought victory was near  After heavy fighting  however  the offensive was halted  Lacking tanks or motorised artillery  the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains  This situation was not helped by the supply lines now being stretched as a result of their advance  109  The sudden stop was also a result of the four Australian Imperial Force  AIF  divisions that were  rushed  down  thus doing what no other army had done  stopping the German advance in its tracks  During that time the first Australian division was hurriedly sent north again to stop the second German breakthrough  British 55th  West Lancashire  Infantry Division troops blinded by tear gas during the Battle of Estaires  10 April 1918  General Foch pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements  Pershing sought instead to field American units as an independent force  These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March  A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the Doullens Conference on 5 November 1917  110  General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the allied forces  Haig  Petain  and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies  Foch assumed a coordinating rather than a directing role  and the British  French  and U S  commands operated largely independently  110  Following Operation Michael  Germany launched Operation Georgette against the northern English Channel ports  The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany  The German Army to the south then conducted Operations Bl cher and Yorck  pushing broadly towards Paris  Operation Marne was launched on 15 July  attempting to encircle Reims and beginning the Second Battle of the Marne  The resulting counterattack  starting the Hundred Days Offensive  marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war  By 20 July the Germans were back across the Marne at their Kaiserschlacht starting lines  111  having achieved nothing  Following this last phase of the war in the West  the German Army never regained the initiative  German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270 000  including many highly trained storm troopers  Meanwhile  Germany was falling apart at home  Anti war marches became frequent and morale in the army fell  Industrial output was 53 percent of 1913 levels  New states under war zone Main articles  Treaty of Brest Litovsk  Democratic Republic of Armenia  Azerbaijan Democratic Republic  and Democratic Republic of Georgia In the late spring of 1918  three new states were formed in the South Caucasus  the Democratic Republic of Armenia  the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic  and the Democratic Republic of Georgia  which declared their independence from the Russian Empire  112  Two other minor entities were established  the Centrocaspian Dictatorship and South West Caucasian Republic  the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian British task force in early 1919   With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917 18  the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance  which commenced in the early months of 1918  Solidarity was briefly maintained when the Transcaucasian Federative Republic was created in the spring of 1918 but collapsed in May  when the Georgians asked and received protection from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance  Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks  113  Allied victory  summer and autumn 1918 Main articles  Hundred Days Offensive and Weimar Republic The Allied counteroffensive  known as the Hundred Days Offensive  began on 8 August 1918  The Battle of Amiens developed with III Corps British Fourth Army on the left  the French First Army on the right  and the Australian and Canadian Corps spearheading the offensive in the centre through Harbonni res  114  115  It involved 414 tanks of the Mark IV and Mark V type  and 120 000 men  They advanced 12 kilometres  7 5 mi  into German held territory in just seven hours  Erich Ludendorff referred to this day as the  Black Day of the German army   114  116  Aerial view of ruins of Vaux  France  1918 The Australian Canadian spearhead at Amiens  a battle that was the beginning of Germany s downfall  46  helped pull forward the British armies to the north and the French armies to the south  On the British Fourth Army front at Amiens  after an advance as far as 14 miles  23 km   German resistance stiffened  and the battle there concluded  But the French Third Army lengthened the Amiens front on 10 August  when it was thrown in on the right of the French First Army  and advanced 4 miles  6 km   liberating Lassigny in fighting which lasted until 16 August  South of the French Third Army  General Charles Mangin  The Butcher  drove his French Tenth Army forward at Soissons on 20 August to capture eight thousand prisoners  two hundred guns  and the Aisne heights overlooking and menacing the German position north of the Vesle  117  Another  Black day   as described by Erich Ludendorff  Meanwhile General Byng of the British Third Army  reporting that the enemy on his front was thinning in a limited withdrawal  was ordered to attack with 200 tanks towards Bapaume  opening the Battle of Albert  with specific orders  To break the enemy s front  in order to outflank the enemy s present battle front   opposite the British Fourth Army at Amiens   46  Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives  and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it  They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks  then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus  117  The British Third Army s 15 mile  24 km  front north of Albert progressed after stalling for a day against the main resistance line to which the enemy had withdrawn  118  Rawlinson s British Fourth Army was able to push its left flank forward between Albert and the Somme  straightening the line between the advanced positions of the Third Army and the Amiens front  which resulted in recapturing Albert at the same time  117  On 26 August the British First Army on the left of the Third Army was drawn into the battle  extending it northward to beyond Arras  The Canadian Corps  already back in the vanguard of the First Army  fought its way from Arras eastward 5 miles  8 km  astride the heavily defended Arras Cambrai area before reaching the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line  breaching them on the 28 and 29 August  Bapaume fell on 29 August to the New Zealand Division of the Third Army  and the Australians  still leading the advance of the Fourth Army  were again able to push forward at Amiens to take Peronne and Mont Saint Quentin on 31 August  Further south  the French First and Third Armies had slowly fought forward while the Tenth Army  which had by now crossed the Ailette and was east of the Chemin des Dames  neared the Alberich position of the Hindenburg Line  119  During the last week of August the pressure along a 70 mile  113 km  front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting  From German accounts   Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on storming enemy  and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines   117  Even to the north in Flanders the British Second and Fifth Armies during August and September were able to make progress  taking prisoners and positions that had previously been denied them  119  American troops in Vladivostok  Siberia  August 1918 Close up view of an American major in the basket of an observation balloon flying over territory near front lines On 2 September the Canadian Corps outflanking of the Hindenburg line  with the breaching of the Wotan Position  made it possible for the Third Army to advance  which sent repercussions all along the Western Front  That same day Oberste Heeresleitung  OHL  had no choice but to issue orders to six armies to withdraw back into the Hindenburg Line in the south  behind the Canal du Nord on the Canadian First Army s front and back to a line east of the Lys in the north  This ceded without a fight the salient seized the previous April  120  According to Ludendorff  We had to admit the necessity    to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle   121  In nearly four weeks of fighting beginning 8 August  over 100 000 German prisoners were taken  75 000 by the BEF and the rest by the French  As of  The Black Day of the German Army   the German High Command realised the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end  The day after that battle Ludenforff told Colonel Mertz   We cannot win the war any more  but we must not lose it either   On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser  who refused it  replying   I see that we must strike a balance  We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance  The war must be ended   On 13 August at Spa  Hindenburg  Ludendorff  the Chancellor  and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily  and on the following day the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable  Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December  and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations  to which the Kaiser responded by instructing Hintz to seek the mediation of the Queen of the Netherlands  Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden   Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter  it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier   On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria  and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation  On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil  and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium  Both peace offers were rejected  and on 24 September OHL informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable  119  September saw the Germans continuing to fight strong rear guard actions and launching numerous counterattacks on lost positions  but only a few succeeded  and then only temporarily  Contested towns  villages  heights  and trenches in the screening positions and outposts of the Hindenburg Line continued to fall to the Allies  with the BEF alone taking 30 441 prisoners in the last week of September  Further small advances eastward would follow the Third Army s victory at Ivincourt on 12 September  the Fourth Army s at Epheny on 18 September  and the French gain of Essigny le Grand a day later  On 24 September a final assault by both the British and French on a 4 mile  6 4 km  front would come within 2 miles  3 2 km  of St  Quentin  119  With the outposts and preliminary defensive lines of the Siegfried and Alberich Positions eliminated  the Germans were now completely back in the Hindenburg Line  With the Wotan position of that line already breached and the Siegfried position in danger of being turned from the north  the time had now come for an Allied assault on the whole length of the line  The Allied attack on the Hindenburg Line  begun on 26 September  included U S  soldiers  The still green American troops suffered problems coping with supply trains for large units on a difficult landscape  122  The following week cooperating French and American units broke through in Champagne at the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge  forcing the Germans off the commanding heights  and closing towards the Belgian frontier  123  The last Belgian town to be liberated before the armistice was Ghent  which the Germans held as a pivot until the Allies brought up artillery  124  125  The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear guard actions  Men of U S  64th Regiment  7th Infantry Division  celebrate the news of the Armistice  11 November 1918 When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 September  the Allies gained control of Serbia and Greece  Ludendorff  having been under great stress for months  suffered something similar to a breakdown  It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence  126  127  Meanwhile  news of Germany s impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces  The threat of mutiny was rife  Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the  valour  of the German Navy  Knowing the government of Prince Maximilian of Baden would veto any such action  Ludendorff decided not to inform him  Nonetheless  word of the impending assault reached sailors at Kiel  Many  refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be suicidal  rebelled and were arrested  Ludendorff took the blame  the Kaiser dismissed him on 26 October  The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food  Its reserves had been used up  even as U S  troops kept arriving at the rate of 10 000 per day  128  Having suffered over 6 million casualties  Germany moved towards peace  Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge of a new government as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies  Telegraphic negotiations with President Wilson began immediately  in the vain hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French  Instead Wilson demanded the abdication of the Kaiser  There was no resistance when the Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann on 9 November declared Germany to be a republic  Imperial Germany was dead  a new Germany had been born  the Weimar Republic  129  Armistices and capitulations The signing of the armistice  In the forest of Compi gne after agreeing to the armistice that ended the war  Foch is seen second from the right  The carriage seen in the background  where the armistice was signed  was later chosen as the symbolic setting of P tain s June 1940 armistice  It was moved to Berlin as a prize  but because of Allied bombing was eventually moved to Crawinkel  Thuringia  where it was deliberately destroyed by SS troops in 1945  130  The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly  Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice  on 29 September 1918 at Saloniki  131  On 30 October  the Ottoman Empire capitulated at Moudros  Armistice of Mudros   131  On 24 October  the Italians began a push which rapidly recovered territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto  This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto  which marked the end of the Austro Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force  The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro Hungarian Empire  During the last week of October  declarations of independence were made in Budapest  Prague  and Zagreb  On 29 October  the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice  But the Italians continued advancing  reaching Trento  Udine  and Trieste  On 3 November Austria Hungary sent a flag of truce to ask for an Armistice  The terms  arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris  were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted  The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti  near Padua  on 3 November  Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the Habsburg Monarchy  Following the outbreak of the German Revolution of 1918 1919  a republic was proclaimed on 9 November  The Kaiser fled to the Netherlands  On 11 November an armistice with Germany was signed in a railroad carriage at Compi gne  At 11 am on 11 November 1918  the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month  a ceasefire came into effect  Opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions  Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was shot by a German sniper at 10 57 and died at 10 58  132  American Henry Gunther was killed 60 seconds before the armistice came into force while charging astonished German troops who were aware the Armistice was nearly upon them  133  The last British soldier to die was Pte George Edwin Ellison  The last casualty of the war was a German  Lieutenant Thomas  who  after 11 am  was walking towards the line to inform Americans who had not yet been informed of the Armistice that they would be vacating the buildings behind them  134  The occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice  The occupying armies consisted of American  Belgian  British and French forces  Allied superiority and the stab in the back legend  November 1918 In November 1918 the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade Germany  Yet at the time of the armistice  no Allied force had crossed the German frontier  the Western Front was still almost 900 mi  1 400 km  from Berlin  and the Kaiser s armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order  These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated  This resulted in the stab in the back legend  135  136  which attributed Germany s defeat not to its inability to continue fighting  even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the 1918 flu pandemic and unfit to fight   but to the public s failure to respond to its  patriotic calling  and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort  particularly by Jews  Socialists  and Bolsheviks  A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months  until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919  Later treaties with Austria  Hungary  Bulgaria  and the Ottoman Empire were signed  However  the negotiation of the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife  the Turkish War of Independence   and a final peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the Republic of Turkey was not signed until 24 July 1923  at Lausanne  Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919  which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned to their home countries  by contrast  most commemorations of the war s end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918  Legally  the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last  the Treaty of Lausanne  was signed  Under its terms  the Allied forces divested Constantinople on 23 August 1923  Technology See also  Technology during World War I and Weapons of World War I Armoured cars The First World War began as a clash of 20th century technology and 19th century tactics  with the inevitably large ensuing casualties  By the end of 1917  however  the major armies  now numbering millions of men  had modernised and were making use of telephone  wireless communication  137 armoured cars  tanks  138  and aircraft  Infantry formations were reorganised  so that 100 man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre  instead  squads of 10 or so men  under the command of a junior NCO  were favoured  Artillery also underwent a revolution  In 1914  cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets  By 1917  indirect fire with guns  as well as mortars and even machine guns  was commonplace  using new techniques for spotting and ranging  notably aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone  Counter battery missions became commonplace  also  and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries  Germany was far ahead of the Allies in utilising heavy indirect fire  The German Army employed 150 and 210 mm howitzers in 1914  when typical French and British guns were only 75 and 105 mm  The British had a 6 inch  152 mm  howitzer  but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled  Germans also fielded Austrian 305 mm and 420 mm guns  and already by the beginning of the war had inventories of various calibers of Minenwerfer ideally suited for trench warfare  139  Much of the combat involved trench warfare  in which hundreds often died for each yard gained  Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during the First World War  Such battles include Ypres  the Marne  Cambrai  the Somme  Verdun  and Gallipoli  The Germans employed the Haber process of nitrogen fixation to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder  despite the British naval blockade  140  Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties 141  and consumed vast quantities of explosives  The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and fragmentation forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet  led by the French  who introduced the Adrian helmet in 1915  It was quickly followed by the Brodie helmet  worn by British Imperial and U S  troops  and in 1916 by the distinctive German Stahlhelm  a design  with improvements  still in use today   Gas  Gas  Quick  boys     Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time  But someone still was yelling out and stumbling  And flound ring like a man in fire or lime    Dim  through the misty panes and thick green light  As under a green sea  I saw him drowning    Wilfred Owen  DULCE ET DECORUM EST  1917 142  The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict  Gases used included chlorine  mustard gas and phosgene  Few war casualties were caused by gas  143  as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created  such as gas masks  The use of chemical warfare and small scale strategic bombing were both outlawed by the 1907 Hague Conventions  and both proved to be of limited effectiveness  144  though they captured the public imagination  145  The most powerful land based weapons were railway guns weighing hundreds of tons apiece  These were nicknamed Big Berthas  even though the namesake was not a railway gun  Germany developed the Paris Gun  able to bombard Paris from over 100 kilometres  62 mi   though shells were relatively light at 94 kilograms  210 lb   While the Allies also had railway guns  German models severely out ranged and out classed them  Aviation Main article  Aviation in World War I RAF Sopwith Camel  In April 1917  the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western Front was 93 flying hours  146  Fixed wing aircraft were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya on 23 October 1911 during the Italo Turkish War for reconnaissance  soon followed by the dropping of grenades and aerial photography the next year  By 1914 their military utility was obvious  They were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack  To shoot down enemy planes  anti aircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed  Strategic bombers were created  principally by the Germans and British  though the former used Zeppelins as well  147  Towards the end of the conflict  aircraft carriers were used for the first time  with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in 1918  148  Johnson s Nieuport 16 armed with Le Prieur rockets for attacking observation balloons  Manned observation balloons  floating high above the trenches  were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms  reporting enemy movements and directing artillery  Balloons commonly had a crew of two  equipped with parachutes   149  so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety   At the time  parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft  with their marginal power output   and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war  they were also opposed by British leadership  who feared they might promote cowardice   150  German trench destroyed by a mine explosion  Approximately 10 000 German troops were killed when the 19 mines were simultaneously detonated  Recognised for their value as observation platforms  balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft  To defend them against air attack  they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft  to attack them  unusual weapons such as air to air rockets were even tried  Thus  the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air to air combat between all types of aircraft  and to the trench stalemate  because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected  The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships  hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines  and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France  147  150  Improvements in naval technology during World War I Germany deployed U boats  submarines  after the war began  Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic  the Kaiserliche Marine employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies  The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U boats led to the development of depth charges  1916   hydrophones  passive sonar  1917   blimps  hunter killer submarines  HMS R 1  1917   forward throwing anti submarine weapons  and dipping hydrophones  the latter two both abandoned in 1918   151  To extend their operations  the Germans proposed supply submarines  1916   Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World War II revived the need  Improvements in ground warfare technology in World War I British Vickers machine gun Trenches  machine guns  air reconnaissance  barbed wire  and modern artillery with fragmentation shells helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate  The British sought a solution with the creation of the tank and mechanised warfare  The first tanks were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916  Mechanical reliability was an issue  but the experiment proved its worth  Within a year  the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds  and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917  by breaking the Hindenburg Line  while combined arms teams captured 8000 enemy soldiers and 100 guns  The conflict also saw the introduction of Light automatic weapons and submachine guns  such as the Lewis Gun  the Browning automatic rifle  and the Bergmann MP18  Flamethrowers and subterranean transport Another new weapon  the flamethrower  was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces  Although not of high tactical value  the flamethrower was a powerful  demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield  It was a dangerous weapon to wield  as its heavy weight made operators vulnerable targets  Trench railways evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food  water  and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed  Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete  War crimes Genocide and ethnic cleansing Main article  Ottoman casualties of World War I See also  Armenian Genocide  Assyrian Genocide  Greek genocide  and Genocide denial Austro Hungarian soldiers executing Serb civilians during World War I occupation  Ma va  1914 The ethnic cleansing of the Ottoman Empire s Armenian population  including mass deportations and executions  during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered genocide  152  The Ottomans saw the entire Armenian population as an enemy 153  that had chosen to side with Russia at the beginning of the war  154  In early 1915  a number of Armenians joined the Russian forces  and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the Tehcir Law  Law on Deportation   This authorized the deportation of the Armenians from eastern provinces of the Empire to Syria between 1915 and 1917  The exact number of deaths is unknown  while Balakian gives a range of 250 000 to 1 5 million for the deaths of Armenians  155  the International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates over 1 million  152  The government of Turkey has consistently rejected charges of genocide  arguing that those who died were victims of inter ethnic fighting  famine  or disease during the First World War  156  Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period  including Assyrians and Greeks  and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination  157  158  159  Remains of Armenians burnt alive in the cattle shed in

Germans living in Volhynia and about 600 000 Jews were deported by the Russian authorities  160  161  162  In 1916  an order was issued to deport around 650 000 Volga Germans to the east as well  but the Russian Revolution prevented this from being carried out  163  Many pogroms accompanied the Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War  60 000 200 000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former Russian Empire  164  165   Rape of Belgium  Main article  Rape of Belgium The German invaders treated any resistance such as sabotaging rail lines as illegal and immoral  and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation  The German army executed over 6 500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914  usually in near random large scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers  The German Army destroyed 15 000 20 000 buildings most famously the university library at Louvain and generated a refugee wave of over a million people  Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents  166  Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories  British propaganda dramatizing the  Rape of Belgium  attracted much attention in the U S   while Berlin said it was legal and necessary because of the threat of  franc tireurs   guerrillas  like those in France in 1870  167  The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the U S   where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany  168  169  Soldiers  experiences Main articles  List of

were conscripted into service  Britain s Imperial War Museum has collected more than 2 500 recordings of soldiers  personal accounts  and selected transcripts  edited by military author Max Arthur  have been published  The Museum believes that historians have not taken full account of this material  and accordingly has made the full archive of recordings available to authors and researchers  170  Surviving veterans  returning home  often found that they could only discuss their experiences amongst themselves  Grouping together  they formed  veterans  associations  or  Legions   Prisoners of war This photograph shows an emaciated Indian Army soldier who survived the Siege of Kut  About 8 million men surrendered and were held in POW camps during the war  All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war  POWs  rate of survival was generally much higher than that of their peers at the front  171  Individual surrenders were uncommon  large units usually surrendered en masse  At the Battle of Tannenberg 92 000 Russians surrendered  When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 1915  some 20 000 Russians became prisoners  Over half of Russian losses  as a proportion of those captured  wounded  or killed  were to prisoner status  for Austria Hungary 32   for Italy 26   for France 12   for Germany 9   for Britain 7   Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1 4 million  not including Russia  which lost 2  3 5 clarification needed  million men as prisoners   From the Central Powers about 3 3 million men became prisoners  172  Germany held 2 5 million prisoners  Russia held 2 9 million  while Britain and France held about 720 000  Most were captured just prior to the Armistice  The U S  held 48 000  The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender  when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down  173  174  Once prisoners reached a camp  conditions were  in general  satisfactory  and much better than in World War II   thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations  However  conditions were terrible in Russia  starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike  about 15 20  of the prisoners in Russia died  In Germany  food was scarce  but only 5  died  175  176  177  German prisoners in a French prison camp The Ottoman Empire often treated POWs poorly  178  Some 11 800 British Empire soldiers  most of them Indians  became prisoners after the Siege of Kut in Mesopotamia in April 1916  4 250 died in captivity  179  Although many were in very bad condition when captured  Ottoman officers forced them to march 1 100 kilometres  684 mi  to Anatolia  A survivor said   We were driven along like beasts  to drop out was to die   180  The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the Taurus Mountains  In Russia  when the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the Austro Hungarian army were released in 1917  they re armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War  While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities  the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia  many of whom served as forced labor  e g   in France until 1920  They were released only after many approaches by the Red Cross to the Allied Supreme Council  181  German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924  182  Military attach s and war correspondents Main article  Military attach s and war correspondents in the First World War Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war  Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern  embedded  positions within the opposing land and naval forces  These military attach s and other observers prepared voluminous first hand accounts of the war and analytical papers  For example  former U S  Army Captain Granville Fortescue followed the developments of the Gallipoli Campaign from an embedded perspective within the ranks of the Turkish defenders  and his report was passed through Turkish censors before being printed in London and New York  183  However  this observer s role was abandoned when the U S  entered the war  as Fortescue immediately re enlisted  sustaining wounds at Forest of Argonne in the Meuse Argonne Offensive  September 1918  184  In depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war  and these post war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict  This was not the first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important  The Russo Japanese War had been closely observed by military attach s  war correspondents and other observers  but  from a 21st century perspective  it is now apparent that a range of tactical lessons were disregarded or not used in the preparations for war in Europe and throughout the Great War  185  Support and opposition to the war Main articles  Opposition to World War I and French Army Mutinies  1917  Support Old England first  self second 1916 In the Balkans  Yugoslav nationalists such as the leader Ante Trumbi  in the Balkans strongly supported the war  desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from Austria Hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent Yugoslavia  186  The Yugoslav Committee was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London  Trumbi  led the Committee  186  In the Middle East  Arab nationalism soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war  with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a pan Arab state  187  In 1916  the Arab Revolt began in Ottoman controlled territories of the Middle East in an effort to achieve independence  187  Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions  One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele d Annunzio  who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war  188  The Italian Liberal Party under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and utilised the Dante Aligheri Society to promote Italian nationalism  189  A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914  190  But European socialists split on national lines  with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as Marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support for war  191  Once the war began  Austrian  British  French  German  and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries  intervention in the war  192  Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it  some were militant supporters of the war  including Benito Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati  193  However  the Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti militarist protestors were killed  resulting in a general strike called Red Week  194  The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro war nationalist members  including Mussolini  194  Mussolini  a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian populated regions of Austria Hungary  formed the pro interventionist Il Popolo d Italia and the Fasci Riviluzionario d Azione Internazionalista   Revolutionary Fasci for International Action   in October 1914 that later developed into the Fasci di Combattimento in 1919  the origin of fascism  195  Mussolini s nationalism enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo  an armaments firm  and other companies to create Il Popolo d Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war  196  In April 1918 the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met  including Czechoslovak  Italian  Polish  Transylvanian  and Yugoslav representatives who urged the Allies to support national self determination for the peoples residing within Austria Hungary  190  Opposition Shortly before the war  British General Horace Smith Dorrien predicted a catastrophic war which should be avoided at almost any cost  The Deserter  1916  Anti war cartoon depicting Jesus facing a firing squad made up of soldiers from five different European countries  1917   Execution at Verdun at the time of the mutinies  The trade union and socialist movements had long voiced their opposition to a war  which they argued would mean only that workers would kill other workers in the interest of capitalism  Once war was declared  however  many socialists and trade unions backed their governments  Among the exceptions were the Bolsheviks  the Socialist Party of America  and the Italian Socialist Party  and individuals such as Karl Liebknecht  Rosa Luxemburg  and their followers in Germany  There were also small anti war groups in Britain and France  Benedict XV  elected to the papacy less than three months into World War I  made the war and its consequences the main focus of his early pontificate  In stark contrast to his predecessor  197  five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace  His first encyclical  Ad Beatissimi Apostolorum  given 1 November 1914  was concerned with this subject  Seen as being biased in favour of the other and resented for weakening national morale  Benedict XV found his abilities and unique position as a religious emissary of peace ignored by the belligerent powers  The 1915 Treaty of London between Italy and the Triple Entente included secret provisions whereby the Allies agreed with Italy to ignore papal peace moves towards the Central Powers  Consequently  the publication of Benedict s proposed seven point Peace Note of August 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except Austria Hungary  198  In Britain  in 1914  the Public Schools Officers  Training Corps annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings  near Salisbury Plain  Head of the British Army Lord Kitchener was to review the cadets  but the imminence of the war prevented him  General Horace Smith Dorrien was sent instead  He surprised the two or three thousand cadets by declaring  in the words of Donald Christopher Smith  a Bermudian cadet who was present   that war should be avoided at almost any cost  that war would solve nothing  that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin  and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated  In our ignorance I  and many of us  felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments  but during the next four years  those of us who survived the holocaust probably not more than one quarter of us learned how right the General s prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it  199  Voicing these sentiments did not hinder Smith Dorien s career  or prevent him from doing his duty in World War I to the best of his abilities  Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict  These included Eugene Debs in the United States and Bertrand Russell in Britain  In the U S   the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918 made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed  disloyal   Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors  99  and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic  The revolt of Czech units in Rumburk in May 1918 was brutally suppressed  and its leaders executed  A number of nationalists opposed intervention  particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to  Irish nationalists staunchly opposed taking part in the intervention of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland  200  The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had begun in 1912  and by 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland between Irish unionists and republicans  200  Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence  culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916  with Germany sending 20 000 rifles to Ireland in order to stir unrest in the United Kingdom  200  The UK government placed Ireland under martial law in response to the Easter Rising  201  Other opposition came from conscientious objectors   some socialist  some religious   who refused to fight  In Britain 16 000 people asked for conscientious objector status  202  Many suffered years of prison  including solitary confinement and bread and water diets  Even after the war  in Britain many job advertisements were marked  No conscientious objectors need apply   The Central Asian Revolt started in the summer of 1916  when the Russian Empire government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service  203  In 1917  a series of mutinies in the French army led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned  In Milan in May 1917  Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war  and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation  204  The Italian army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists  who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the city  Almost fifty people  including three Italian soldiers  were killed and over 800 people arrested  204  German Revolution  November 1918 The Conscription Crisis of 1917 in Canada erupted when conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden brought in compulsory military service over the objection of French speaking Quebecers  205  Out of approximately 625 000 Canadians who served  about 60 000 were killed and another 173 000 wounded  206  In 1917  Emperor Charles I of Austria secretly entered into peace negotiations with the Allied powers  with his brother in law Sixtus as intermediary  without the knowledge of his ally Germany  He failed  however  because of the resistance of Italy  207  In September 1917  Russian soldiers in France began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied  208  In Russia  opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees  which helped foment the October Revolution of 1917  with the call going up for  bread  land  and peace   The Bolsheviks agreed to a peace treaty with Germany  the peace of Brest Litovsk  despite its harsh conditions  In northern Germany  the end of October 1918  saw the beginning of the German Revolution of 1918 1919  Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last  large scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost  this initiated the uprising  The sailors  revolt which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II  Conscription As the war slowly turned into a war of attrition  conscription was implemented in some countries  This issue was particularly explosive in Canada and Australia  In the former it opened a political gap between French Canadians  who claimed their true loyalty was to Canada and not the British Empire  and members of the Anglophone majority  who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada  Prime Minister Robert Borden pushed through a Military Service Act  provoking the Conscription Crisis of 1917  In Australia  a sustained pro conscription campaign by Prime Minister Billy Hughes caused a split in the Australian Labor Party  so Hughes formed the Nationalist Party of Australia in 1917 to pursue the matter  Nevertheless  the labour movement  the Catholic Church  and Irish nationalist expatriates successfully opposed Hughes  push  which was rejected in two plebiscites  Conscription put into uniform nearly every physically fit man in Britain  six of ten million eligible  Of these  about 750 000 lost their lives and 1 700 000 were wounded  Most deaths were to young unmarried men  however  160 000 wives lost husbands and 300 000 children lost fathers  209  Aftermath Main article  Aftermath of World War I Health and economic effects The French military cemetery with Douaumont ossuary  which contains the remains of more than 130 000 unknown soldiers  No other war had changed the map of Europe so dramatically  Four empires disappeared  the German  Austro Hungarian  Ottoman  and Russian  Four dynasties  together with their ancillary aristocracies  all fell after the war  the Hohenzollerns  the Habsburgs  the Romanovs  and the Ottomans  Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged  as was France  with 1 4 million soldiers dead  210  not counting other casualties  Germany and Russia were similarly affected  211  The war had profound economic consequences  Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918  8 million were killed  7 million were permanently disabled  and 15 million were seriously injured  Germany lost 15 1  of its active male population  Austria Hungary lost 17 1   and France lost 10 5   212  About 750 000 German civilians died from starvation caused by the British blockade during the war  213  By the end of the war  famine had killed approximately 100 000 people in Lebanon  214  The best estimates of the death toll from the Russian famine of 1921 run from 5 million to 10 million people  215  By 1922  there were between 4 5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I  the Russian Civil War  and the subsequent famine of 1920 1922  216  Numerous anti Soviet Russians fled the country after the Revolution  by the 1930s the northern Chinese city of Harbin had 100 000 Russians  217  Thousands more emigrated to France  England  and the United States  Diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions  In 1914 alone  louse borne epidemic typhus killed 200 000 in Serbia  218  From 1918 to 1922  Russia had about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths from epidemic typhus  219  Whereas before World War I Russia had about 3 5 million cases of malaria  its people suffered more than 13 million cases in 1923  220  In addition  a major influenza epidemic spread around the world  Overall  the 1918 flu pandemic killed at least 50 million people  221  222  Lobbying by Chaim Weizmann and fear that American Jews would encourage the USA to support Germany culminated in the British government s Balfour Declaration of 1917  endorsing creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine  223  A total of more than 1 172 000 Jewish soldiers served in the Allied and Central Power forces in World War I  including 275 000 in Austria Hungary and 450 000 in Czarist Russia  224  Emergency military hospital during the Spanish flu pandemic  which killed about 675 000 people in the United States alone  Camp Funston  Kansas  1918 The social disruption and widespread violence of the Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War sparked more than 2 000 pogroms in the former Russian Empire  mostly in the Ukraine  225  An estimated 60 000 200 000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities  226  In the aftermath of World War I  Greece fought against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal  a war which resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty of Lausanne  227  According to various sources  228  several hundred thousand Pontic Greeks died during this period  229  Peace treaties and national boundaries After the war  the Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers  The 1919 Treaty of Versailles officially ended the war  Building on Wilson s 14th point  the Treaty of Versailles also brought into being the League of Nations on 28 June 1919  230  231  In signing the treaty  Germany acknowledged responsibility for the war  and agreed to pay enormous war reparations and award territory to the victors  The  Guilt Thesis  became a controversial explanation of later events among analysts in Britain and the United States  The Treaty of Versailles caused enormous bitterness in Germany  which nationalist movements  especially the Nazis  exploited with a conspiracy theory they called the Dolchstosslegende  Stab in the back legend   The Weimar Republic lost the former colonial possessions and was saddled with accepting blame for the war  as well as paying punitive reparations for it  Unable to pay them with exports  as a result of territorial losses and postwar recession   232  Germany did so by borrowing from the United States  Runaway inflation in the 1920s contributed to the economic collapse of the Weimar Republic  and the payment of reparations was suspended in 1931 following the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the beginnings of the Great Depression worldwide  Greek refugees from Smyrna  Turkey  1922 Austria Hungary was partitioned into several successor states  including Austria  Hungary  Czechoslovakia  and Yugoslavia  largely but not entirely along ethnic lines  Transylvania was shifted from Hungary to Greater Romania  The details were contained in the Treaty of Saint Germain and the Treaty of Trianon  As a result of the Treaty of Trianon  3 3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule  Although the Hungarians made up 54  of the population of the pre war Kingdom of Hungary  only 32  of its territory was left to Hungary  Between 1920 and 1924  354 000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania  Czechoslovakia  and Yugoslavia  The Russian Empire  which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution  lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of Estonia  Finland  Latvia  Lithuania  and Poland were carved from it  Bessarabia was re attached to Greater Romania  as it had been a Romanian territory for more than a thousand years  233  The Ottoman Empire disintegrated  and much of its non Anatolian territory was awarded to various Allied powers as protectorates  The Turkish core was reorganised as the Republic of Turkey  The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the Treaty of S vres of 1920  This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the Turkish republican movement  leading to the Turkish Independence War and  ultimately  to the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne  Legacy     Strange  friend   I said   Here is no cause to mourn    None   said the other   Save the undone years       Wilfred Owen  Strange Meeting  1918 142  Main articles  World War I in popular culture and World War I memorials The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war  and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities  Memorials The Beaumont Hamel Newfoundland Memorial in the Somme  Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns  Close to battlefields  those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission  the American Battle Monuments Commission  the German War Graves Commission  and Le Souvenir fran ais  Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead  such as the Menin Gate memorial and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme  Surgeon Lt  Col  John McCrae of Canada  author of In Flanders Fields  died in 1918 of pneumonia  On 3 May 1915  during the Second Battle of Ypres  Lieutenant Alexis Helmer was killed  At his graveside  his friend John McCrae  M D   of Guelph  Ontario  Canada  wrote the memorable poem In Flanders Fields as a salute to those who perished in the Great War  Published in Punch on 8 December 1915  it is still recited today  especially on Remembrance Day and Memorial Day  234  235  Liberty Memorial in Kansas City  Missouri  is a United States memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I  The site for the Liberty Memorial was dedicated on 1 November 1921  On this day  the supreme Allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100 000 people  It was the only time in history these leaders were together in one place  In attendance were Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium  General Armando Diaz of Italy  Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France  General Pershing of the United States  and Admiral D  R  Beatty of Great Britain  After three years of construction  the Liberty Memorial was completed and President Calvin Coolidge delivered the dedication speech to a crowd of 150 000 people in 1926  Liberty Memorial is also home to The National World War I Museum  the only museum dedicated solely to World War I in the United States  Cultural memory The First World War had a lasting impact on social memory  It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the Victorian period  and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed  236  Historian Samuel Hynes explained  A generation of innocent young men  their heads full of high abstractions like Honour  Glory and England  went off to war to make the world safe for democracy  They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals  Those who survived were shocked  disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences  and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans  but the old men at home who had lied to them  They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war  and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance  237  A village war memorial to soldiers killed in World War I  This has become the most common perception of the First World War  perpetuated by the art  cinema  poems  and stories published subsequently  Films such as All Quiet on the Western Front  Paths of Glory and King  amp  Country have perpetuated the idea  while war time films including Camrades  Flanders Poppies  and Shoulder Arms indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive  238  Likewise  the art of Paul Nash  John Nash  Christopher Nevison  and Henry Tonks in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception  while popular war time artists such as Muirhead Bone painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate  237  Several historians who   have since countered these interpretations  Siegfried Sassoon  May 1915  These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events  In every respect  the war was much more complicated than they suggest  In recent years  historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular clich  of the First World War  It has been pointed out that  although the losses were devastating  their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited  The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line  including comradeship  boredom  and even enjoyment  have been recognised  The war is not now seen as a  fight about nothing   but as a war of ideals  a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy  It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges  and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918  a great forgotten victory  238  Though these historians have discounted as  myths  237  239  these perceptions of the war  they are nevertheless prevalent across much of society  citation needed  They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences  reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as  aimless  following the contrasting Second World War  and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s  238  The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected  238  Social trauma The social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways  which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate  240  Some people who   were revolted by nationalism and its results  and began to work towards a more internationalist world  supporting organisations such as the League of Nations  Pacifism became increasingly popular  Others had the opposite reaction  feeling that only strength and military might could be relied upon in a chaotic and inhumane world  Anti modernist views were an outgrowth of the many changes taking place in society  Book distributed by the U S  War Department to veterans in 1919 The experiences of the war led to a collective trauma shared by many from all participating countries  The optimism of la belle  poque was destroyed  and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the Lost Generation  241  For years afterwards  people mourned the dead  the missing  and the many disabled  242  Many soldiers returned with severe trauma  suffering from shell shock  also called neurasthenia  a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder   243  Many more returned home with few after effects  however  their silence about the war contributed to the conflict s growing mythological status  240  In the United Kingdom  mass mobilisation  large casualty rates  and the collapse of the Edwardian era made a strong impression on society  Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front  or had positive memories of their service  the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception  240  Such historians as Dan Todman  Paul Fussell  and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect  240  Discontent in Germany The rise of Nazism and fascism included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post war changes  Similarly  the popularity of the Stab in the back legend  German  Dolchsto legende  was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict  This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common  and the German populace came to see themselves as victims  The Dolchsto legende s popular acceptance in Germany played a significant role in the rise of Nazism  A sense of disillusionment and cynicism became pronounced  with nihilism growing  Many believed the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it because of the high fatalities among a generation of men  the dissolution of governments and empires  and the collapse of capitalism and imperialism  Communist and socialist movements around the world drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity  These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war  Out of German discontent with the still controversial Treaty of Versailles  Adolf Hitler was able to gain popularity and power  244  245  World War II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by the First World War  in fact  it was common for Germans in the 1930s and 1940s to justify acts of international aggression because of perceived injustices imposed by the victors of the First World War  246  247  248  The establishment of the modern state of Israel and the roots of the continuing Israeli Palestinian Conflict are partially found in the unstable power dynamics of the Middle East which resulted from World War I  249  Prior to the end of the war  the Ottoman Empire had maintained a modest level of peace and stability throughout the Middle East  250  With the fall of the Ottoman government  power vacuums developed and conflicting claims to land and nationhood began to emerge  251  The political boundaries drawn by the victors of the First World War were quickly imposed  sometimes after only cursory consultation with the local population  In many cases  these continue to be problematic in the 21st century struggles for national identity  252  253  While the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I was pivotal in contributing to the modern political situation of the Middle East  including the Arab Israeli conflict  254  255  256  the end of Ottoman rule also spawned lesser known disputes over water and other natural resources  257  Further information  Sykes Picot Agreement The announcing of the armistice on November 11  1918  Philadelphia  Views in the United States U S  intervention in the war  as well as the Wilson administration itself  became deeply unpopular  This was reflected in the U S  Senate s rejection of the Versailles Treaty and membership in the League of Nations  In the interwar era  a consensus arose that U S  intervention had been a mistake  and the Congress passed laws in an attempt to preserve U S  neutrality in any future conflict  Polls taken in 1937 and the opening months of World War II established that nearly 60  regarded intervention in WWI as a mistake  with only 28  opposing that view  But  in the period between the fall of France and the attack on Pearl Harbor  public opinion changed dramatically and  for the first time  a narrow plurality rejected the idea that the war had been a mistake  258  New national identities Poland reemerged as an independent country  after more than a century  As a  minor Entente nation  and the country with the most casualties per capita  259  260  261  the Kingdom of Serbia and its dynasty became the backbone of the new multinational state  the Kingdom of Serbs  Croats and Slovenes  later renamed Yugoslavia   Czechoslovakia  combining the Kingdom of Bohemia with parts of the Kingdom of Hungary  became a new nation  Russia became the Soviet Union and lost Finland  Estonia  Lithuania  and Latvia  which became independent countries  The Ottoman Empire was soon replaced by Turkey and several other countries in the Middle East  Map of territorial changes in Europe after World War I In the British Empire  the war unleashed new forms of nationalism  In Australia and New Zealand the Battle of Gallipoli became known as those nations   Baptism of Fire   It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought  and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians  not just subjects of the British Crown  Anzac Day  commemorating the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps  celebrates this defining moment  262  263  After the Battle of Vimy Ridge  where the Canadian divisions fought together for the first time as a single corps  Canadians began to refer to theirs as a nation  forged from fire   264  Having succeeded on the same battleground where the  mother countries  had previously faltered  they were for the first time respected internationally for their own accomplishments  Canada entered the war as a Dominion of the British Empire and remained so  although she emerged with a greater measure of independence  265  266  While the other Dominions were represented by Britain  Canada was an independent negotiator and signatory of the Versailles Treaty  Economic effects One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain  France  the United States  and the Dominions of the British Empire  In order to harness all the power of their societies  governments created new ministries and powers  New taxes were levied and laws enacted  all designed to bolster the war effort  many have lasted to this day  Similarly  the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments  such as in Austria Hungary and Germany  however  any analysis of the long term effects were clouded by the defeat of these governments  Germany  1923  banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper  Millions of middle class Germans were ruined by hyperinflation  When the war began in 1914  a dollar was worth 4 2 marks  by November 1923  the dollar was at 4 2 trillion 267  marks  268  Gross domestic product  GDP  increased for three Allies  Britain  Italy  and U S    but decreased in France and Russia  in neutral Netherlands  and in the three main Central Powers  The shrinkage in GDP in Austria  Russia  France  and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40   In Austria  for example  most pigs were slaughtered  so at war s end there was no meat   The Girl Behind the Gun    women workers  1915 In all nations the government s share of GDP increased  surpassing fifty percent in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain  To pay for purchases in the United States  Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on Wall Street  President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916  but allowed a great increase in U S  government lending to the Allies  After 1919  the U S  demanded repayment of these loans  The repayments were  in part  funded by German reparations  which  in turn  were supported by American loans to Germany  This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid  In 1934  Britain owed the US  4 4 billion 269  of World War I debt  270  Macro  and micro economic consequences devolved from the war  Families were altered by the departure of many men  With the death or absence of the primary wage earner  women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers  At the same time  industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war  This aided the struggle for voting rights for women  271  In Britain  rationing was finally imposed in early 1918  limited to meat  sugar  and fats  butter and oleo   but not bread  The new system worked smoothly  From 1914 to 1918 trade union membership doubled  from a little over four million to a little over eight million  Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917 1918 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices  alcohol control  pay disputes  fatigue from overtime and working on Sundays  and inadequate housing  Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply had become difficult from traditional sources  Geologists such as Albert Ernest Kitson were called upon to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies  Kitson discovered important new deposits of manganese  used in munitions production  in the Gold Coast  272  Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles  the so called  war guilt  clause  declared Germany and its allies responsible for all  loss and damage  suffered by the Allies during the war and provided the basis for reparations  The total reparations demanded was 132 billion gold marks  which was far more than the total German gold or foreign exchange  The economic problems that the payments brought  and German resentment at their imposition  are usually cited as one of the more significant factors that led to the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler  After Germany s defeat in World War II  payment of the reparations was not resumed  There was  however  outstanding German debt that the Weimar Republic had used to pay the reparations  Germany finished paying off the reparations in October 2010  273  See
