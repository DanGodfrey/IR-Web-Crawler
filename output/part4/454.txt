18th century  Jacob Roggeveen  1659 1729   a Dutchman  was the first known European to sight the Samoan islands in 1722  This visit was followed by the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville  1729 1811   who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768  Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when English missionaries and traders began arriving  Early Western contact included a battle in the eighteenth century between French explorers and islanders in Tutuila  for which the Samoans were blamed in the West  giving them a reputation for ferocity  The site of this battle is called Massacre Bay   edit  19th century Mission work in the Samoas had begun in late 1830 when John Williams of the London Missionary Society arrived from The Cook Islands and Tahiti  3  By that time  the Samoans had gained a reputation for being savage and warlike  as violent altercations had occurred between natives and European visitors  Nevertheless  by the late nineteenth century  French  British  German  and American vessels routinely stopped at Samoa  as they valued Pago Pago Harbor as a refueling station for coal fired shipping and whaling  In March 1889  a German naval force invaded a village in Samoa  and by doing so destroyed some American property  Three American warships then entered the Apia harbor and prepared to engage three German warships found there  4  Before guns were fired  a typhoon wrecked both the American and German ships  A compulsory armistice was called because of the lack of warships  4   edit  20th century See also  Samoan crisis and Samoan Civil War German  British and American warships in Apia harbour  Samoa 1899  At the turn of the twentieth century  international rivalries in the latter half of the century were settled by the 1899 Tripartite Convention in which Germany and the United States partitioned the Samoan Islands into two parts  5  the eastern island group became a territory of the United States  the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu a in 1904  and is today known as American Samoa  the western islands  by far the greater landmass  became known as German Samoa after Britain vacated all claims to Samoa and accepted termination of German rights in Tonga and certain areas in the Solomon Islands and West Africa  6  Forerunners to the Tripartite Convention of 1899 were the Washington Conference of 1887  the Treaty of Berlin of 1889 and the Anglo German Agreement on Samoa of 1899   edit  A U S  territory is born Pago Pago harbor today and inter island dock area  The following year  the U S  formally occupied its portion  a smaller group of eastern islands  one of which surrounds the noted harbor of Pago Pago  After the United States Navy took possession of eastern Samoa on behalf of the United States  the existing coaling station at Pago Pago Bay was expanded into a full naval station  known as United States Naval Station Tutuila under the command of a commandant  The Navy secured a Deed of Cession of Tutuila in 1900 and a Deed of Cession of Manu a in 1904  The last sovereign of Manu a  the Tui Manu a Elisala  was forced to sign a Deed of Cession of Manu a following a series of U S  Naval trials  known as the  Trial of the Ipu   in Pago Pago  Ta u  and aboard a Pacific Squadron gunboat  7  The territory became known as the U S  Naval Station Tutuila  On July 17  1911  the U S  Naval Station Tutuila  which was composed of Tutuila  Aunu u and Manu a  was officially renamed American Samoa  8  9   edit  The early century and WW I Swains Island  which had been included in the list of guano islands appertaining to the US and bonded under the Guano Islands Act  was annexed in 1925 by Pub  Res  68 75  10  After World War I  during the time of the Mau movement in Western Samoa  then a League of Nations mandate governed by New Zealand   there was a corresponding American Samoa Mau movement  7  led by Samuelu Ripley  a World War I veteran who was from Leone village  Tutuila  After meetings in the United States mainland  he was prevented from disembarking from the ship that brought him home to American Samoa and was not allowed to return because the American Samoa Mau movement was suppressed by the U S  Navy  In 1930 the U S  Congress sent a committee to investigate the status of American Samoa  led by Americans who had had a part in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii   edit  The Pacific War  WW II  During World War II  U S  Marines in Samoa outnumbered the local population  having a huge cultural influence  Young Samoan men from the age of 14 and above were combat trained by U S  military personnel  Samoans served in various capacities during World War II  including as combatants  medical personnel  code personnel  and ship repairmen  After World War II when    Organic Act 4500  a U S  Department of Interior sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa  was defeated in Congress  primarily through the efforts of Samoan chiefs  led by Tuiasosopo Mariota  11  These chiefs  efforts led to the creation of a local legislature  the American Samoa Fono which meets in the village of Fagatogo  often considered the territory s de facto and de jure capital  the United States regards Pago Pago as the official capital of the territory    edit  The latter century  1951 to 1999 In time when    the Navy appointed governor was replaced by a locally elected one  Although technically considered  unorganized  since the U S  Congress has not passed an Organic Act for the territory  American Samoa is self governing under a constitution that became effective on July 1  1967  The U S  Territory of American Samoa is on the United Nations list of Non Self Governing Territories  a listing which is disputed by the territorial government officials  who do consider themselves to be self governing  While the two Samoas share language and ethnicity  their cultures have recently followed different paths  with American Samoans often emigrating to Hawai i and the U S  mainland  and adopting many U S  customs  such as the playing of American football and baseball  Western Samoans have tended to emigrate instead to New Zealand  whose influence has made the sports of rugby and cricket more popular in the western islands  Travel writer Paul Theroux noted that there were marked differences between the societies in Samoa and American Samoa   edit  21st century Due to economic hardship  military service has been seen as an opportunity in American Samoa and other U S  Overseas territories  12  this has meant that there have been a disproportionate number of casualties per population compared to other parts of the United States  As of 23 March 2009  2009  03 23  update  there have been 10 American Samoans who have died in Iraq  and 2 who have died in
