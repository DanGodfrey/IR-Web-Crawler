and blue motif  In March 1942  Nazi officer Johann Schmidt  Hugo Weaving  and his men invade T nsberg  Norway  to steal a mysterious tesseract possessing untold powers  Meanwhile in New York City  Steve Rogers  Chris Evans  is rejected for World War II military duty because of various health and physical issues  While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend Bucky Barnes  Sebastian Stan   Rogers again attempts to enlist  Overhearing Rogers  conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war  Dr  Abraham Erskine  Stanley Tucci  allows Rogers to enlist  He is recruited as part of a  super soldier  experiment under Erskine  Colonel Chester Phillips  Tommy Lee Jones   and British agent Peggy Carter  Hayley Atwell   Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine s claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure  but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self sacrificing bravery  The night before the treatment  Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered side effects  Back in Europe  Schmidt and Dr  Arnim Zola  Toby Jones  successfully harness the energies of the tesseract  intending to use the power to fuel Zola s inventions  Schmidt  having discovered Erskine s location  dispatches an assassin to kill him  In America  Erskine subjects Rogers to the super soldier treatment  injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with  vita rays   After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular  one of the attendees kills Erskine  revealing himself to be Schmidt s assassin  Heinz Kruger  Richard Armitage   Rogers pursues and captures Kruger  but the assassin commits suicide by cyanide capsule before he can be interrogated  With Erskine dead and the super soldier formula lost  U S  Senator Brandt  Michael Brandon  has Rogers tour the nation in a colorful costume as  Captain America  to promote war bonds  rather than allow scientists to study him and attempt to rediscover Erskine s formula  In 1943  while on tour in Italy performing for active servicemen  Rogers learns that Barnes  unit was lost in a battle against Schmidt s forces  Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead  Rogers has Carter and Howard Stark  Dominic Cooper  fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt  Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt s HYDRA organization  freeing Barnes and the other captured soldiers  Rogers confronts Schmidt  who reveals his face to be a mask  removing it to display the red  skull like face that earned him the sobriquet  the Red Skull   Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers  Rogers recruits Barnes  Dum Dum Dugan  Neal McDonough   Gabe Jones  Derek Luke   Jim Morita  Kenneth Choi   James Montgomery Falsworth  J  J  Feild   and Jacques Dernier  Bruno Ricci  to attack the other known HYDRA bases  Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment  in particular a circular shield made of vibranium  a rare  nigh indestructible metal  Rogers and his team successfully sabotage various HYDRA operations  The team later assaults a train carrying Zola  Zola is captured  but Barnes falls from the train to his apparent death  Using information extracted from Zola  the final HYDRA stronghold is located and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on American cities  Rogers clambers aboard Schmidt s aircraft as it takes off  During the subsequent fight  the tesseract s container is damaged  Schmidt physically handles the tesseract  causing him to dissolve in a bright light  The tesseract falls to the floor  burning through the plane and falling to Earth  Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons  Rogers crashes it in the Arctic  Stark later recovers the tesseract from the ocean floor  but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft  Rogers awakens in a 1940s style hospital room  Deducing from an anachronistic radio broadcast that something is wrong  he flees outside into what is revealed to be present day Times Square  where Nick Fury  Samuel L  Jackson  tells him he has been  asleep  for nearly 70 years  In a post credits scene  Fury approaches Rogers  proposing a mission with worldwide ramifications   edit  Cast Kevin Feige  Joe Johnston  Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con International  Chris Evans as Steve Rogers   Captain America  A frail  sickly young man who is enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum in order to aid the United States war effort  4  Evans  who previously worked with Marvel as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four film series  said he declined the part three times before signing a six picture deal with Marvel  explaining that   At the time  I remember telling a buddy of mine   If the movie bombs  I m fucked  If the movie hits  I m fucked  I was just scared  I realized my whole decision making process was fear based  and you never want to make a decision out of fear  I can t believe I was almost too chicken to play Captain America   5  He ultimately agreed to the role  saying   I think Marvel is doing a lot of good things right now  and it s a fun character      I think the story of Steve Rogers is great  He s a great guy  Even if it  were  just a script about anybody  I would probably want to do it  So it wasn t necessarily about the comic itself   6  Regarding the extent of the character s abilities Evans remarked   He would crush the Olympics  Any Olympic sport he s gonna dominate  He can jump higher  run faster  lift stronger weight  but he can be injured  He could roll an ankle and be out for the season  He s not perfect  he s not untouchable  So a lot of the effects  if I m going to punch someone they re not going to put them on a cable and fly them back 50 feet  but he s going to go down  probably not getting back up  which I think humanizes it  It makes it something that  again  I think everyone can relate to a little bit more  which I really like   7  Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter  An officer with the Strategic Scientific Reserve and the love interest of Captain America  Regarding her preparation for the role  she said   I m training at the moment six days a week to make her a bit more military and make it convincing that I could kick butt   8  About the character  Atwell stated   I likened her character to that famous Ginger Rogers quote  She can do everything Captain America can do  but backwards and in high heels  She s an English soldier through and through  although she always looks fabulous  She might stand there with a machine gun shooting Nazis  but she s obviously gone to the loo beforehand and applied a bit of lipstick  She doesn t need to be rescued  That s exciting to me   her strength   9   I think she s quite stubborn  a slightly frustrated woman who struggles with being a woman in that time  But more importantly she s a modern woman and she sees something in Captain America that she relates to  and becomes kindred spirits  He treats her very differently to how she s been treated by lots of men  in this kind of dominated world she lives in  So she s very much a fighter   10  Hugo Weaving as Johann Schmidt   Red Skull  Captain America s nemesis and Adolf Hitler s head of advanced weaponry  whose own plan for world domination involves a magical object known as the Tesseract  5  11  12  In the film  Red Skull is the commander of the terrorist organization HYDRA  13  Weaving stated that he patterned Red Skull s accent on those of Werner Herzog and Klaus Maria Brandauer  14  About the character  Weaving remarked   I think the major difference between Skull and Cap  they ve both had the serum  and the serum seems to augment certain qualities that each of them have  Cap is much more in tune with other people I think  Schmidt is in tune with himself  and his own needs  and his own ego  so I suppose it augments that  From that point of view  they re quite opposite   15  Sebastian Stan as Sgt  James  Bucky  Barnes  Steve Rogers  best friend  Stan has signed on for  five or six pictures   16  He revealed that he didn t know anything about the comic books  but watched a lot of documentaries and films about World War II in preparation for the role  calling Band of Brothers  very helpful   About the role  Stan stated   Steve Rogers and Bucky are both orphans and kind of like brothers  They kind of grow up together and look after each other  It s a very human  relatable thing     I also wanted to look out for how their relationship changes once Steve Rogers becomes Captain America  There s always a competition and they re always one upping each other  I paid attention to how Bucky is affected by Steve s change and suddenly Steve is this leader   17  Tommy Lee Jones as Col  Chester Phillips  In the early comics  Phillips recruited Steve Rogers to join Project Rebirth  the secret experiment that created the super soldier known as Captain America  The character was updated for the film  18  Jones described his character as  the one you ve seen in a thousand movies  the gruff  skeptical officer overseeing a team of talented  slightly sarcastic  specially talented soldiers   19  Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark  The father of Tony Stark  who worked on various government projects dating back to the World War II era  20  21  Rogers  unsatisfied with his USO issued Captain America costume  turns to Stark to design a sensible ensemble made of sophisticated fabrics  22  About the role  Cooper stated   It s an opportunity where you can see his future because I know the guy who becomes my son and I see myself as an older version in Iron Man 2 which is great for an actor to have those tools  All I know of him is that he s a fantastic engineer and inventor and a very slick Howard Hughes type that s into aviation and women   23  Neal McDonough as Timothy  Dum Dum  Dugan  A member of Steve Rogers  squad of commandos  McDonough said he grew Dugan s trademark mustache and wore the character s signature bowler hat  About his role in film he remarked   Oh  I m going to see a lot of action   I m  the go to guy  so I m very happy with that   24  Derek Luke as Gabe Jones  An African American member of Rogers  squad of commandos  Luke said he was cast without a script or much of a description of the character  As to why he took the part   I just believed that Marvel was doing some really great work  great messages in films  The good versus evil and I was just like   How can I be down    25  Stanley Tucci as Dr  Abraham Erskine  The scientist who created the Super Soldier Serum  26  Tucci said that what drew him to the role was the opportunity to do a German accent  which was something he always wanted to try  27  Kenneth Choi as Jim Morita  A Japanese American member of Rogers  squad of commandos  Choi said he was the last actor to audition for the part and that he read sides from Saving Private Ryan  About his preparation for the role  Choi said    I  did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the  Nisei  soldiers  or Japanese American soldiers  I wanted to get as much true  real life information for a guy like Jim Morita fighting in WWII  I felt that if I had built a factual basis for him  I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe  which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances   28  Bruno Ricci as Jacques Dernier  A French member of Rogers  squad of commandos  Ricci auditioned for and got the part while filming the French series The Hawk  29  J  J  Feild as James Montgomery Falsworth  A British member of Rogers  squad of commandos  Feild called his part in the film  a very physical job  I play one of the Captain s sidekicks so I ve been running around shooting things and blowing things up and trying to look cool for about a year   30  Additionally  Toby Jones was cast as Arnim Zola  a biochemist for the Nazi party  31 Richard Armitage portrays Heinz Kruger  the Red Skull s top assassin  32 Samuel L  Jackson reprises his role as Nick Fury  the director of the super spy agency  S H I E L D  33 Stan Lee has a cameo appearance as a general  34   edit  Production  edit  Development  He  Captain America  wants to serve his country  but he s not this sort of jingoistic American flag waver  He s just a good person  We make a point of that in the script  Don t change who you are once you go from Steve Rogers to this super soldier  you have to stay who you are inside  that s really what s important more than your strength and everything    It s also the idea that this is not about America so much as it is about the spirit of doing the right thing  It s an international cast and an international story  It s about what makes America great and what make the rest of the world great too   Joe Johnston  director of Captain America  The First Avenger  about the film  35  In April 1997  Marvel was in negotiations with Mark Gordon and Gary Levinsohn to produce Captain America  and Larry Wilson and Leslie Bohem were set to write a script  36  In May 2000  Marvel teamed with Artisan Entertainment to help finance the film  37  However  a lawsuit arose between Marvel Comics and Joe Simon over the ownership of Captain America copyrights  disrupting the development process of the film  The lawsuit was eventually settled in September 2003  38  In 2005  Marvel received a  525 million investment from Merrill Lynch  allowing them to independently produce ten films  including Captain America  Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film  37  39  40  Originally  the film would stand alone  producer Kevin Feige said  about half  the movie would be set during World War II before moving into the modern day  41  Producer Avi Arad said   The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man  out of time   coming back today  looking at our world through the eyes of someone who thought the perfect world was small town United States  Sixty years go by  and who are we today  Are we better   He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence  and claimed he had  someone in mind to be the star  and definitely someone in mind to be the director   42  In February 2006  Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date  43 Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy  but he chose to make Iron Man instead  44  In July 2006  David Self was hired to write the script  45  He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because  my dad told me I could one day be Captain America   46 Joe Johnston met with Marvel to discuss directing the film  47  Captain America was put on hold during the 2007 2008 Writers Guild of America strike  However  in January 2008  Marvel Entertainment reached an interim comprehensive agreement with the Writers Guild of America that would put writers immediately back to work on various projects that were under the company s development  48  On May 5  2008   after the success of Iron Man   Marvel announced the film The First Avenger  Captain America  the working title  for release in May 6  2011  before being pushed back to July 22   49 Louis Leterrier  director of The Incredible Hulk  viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services  but Marvel turned him down  50  Johnston finally signed on in November 2008  47  and he hired Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to rewrite  51  Feige cited Johnston s directorial work on October Sky and The Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy to explain why he was an appropriate choice  Raiders of the Lost Ark was an influence on the film  because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece  52  When asked whether anti US sentiments would affect the film s box office  Feige said   Marvel is perceived pretty well around the world right now  and I think putting another uber Marvel hero into the worldwide box office would be a good thing      We have to deal with much the same way that Captain America  when thawed from the Arctic ice  entered a world that he didn t recognize   similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s  41  Likewise  Arad noted   Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies  for hope all around the world  He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then  So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world  it s not about one place  it s about the world and I think  on  that basis it will be very successful   53  Later  after the election of US President Barack Obama  Feige commented   The idea of change and hope has permeated the country  regardless of politics  and that includes Hollywood  Discussions in all our development meetings include the Zeitgeist and how it s changed in the last two weeks  Things are being adjusted   54   edit  Pre production In December 2009  director Joe Johnston indicated that he planned to start filming in April 2010  55  In a separate interview that month  he described the film s pre production   Rick Heinrichs is production designing and we re set up down in Manhattan Beach  California      We have eight or ten really talented artists  and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say   Hey  wouldn t it be cool if we could do this   It s that phase of the production where money doesn t matter   Let s put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and  then later  see what we can afford    The film  he said  will begin  in 1942  1943  during World War II   The stuff in the  60s and  70s  comic books  we re sort of avoiding  We re going back to the  40s  and then forward to what they re doing with Captain America now   56  In February 2010  Johnston stated that the World War II era super team the Invaders will appear in  the entire second half  of the film  57  though in November he refuted speculation that the Sub Mariner  an Invaders team member in the comics  would be included  58  He later explained that  the Invaders  had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film  59  The design as a whole tried to create technology that could be built in the 1940s  though with the added Cube technology in HYDRA s case  Abandoned Nazi projects or actual vehicles from the period were used as inspiration   for instance  the Red Skull s car was based on two Mercedes Benz vehicles from the 1930s  the 540K and the G4  60  Variety reported in March 2010 that Chris Evans was cast as Captain America and Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull  11  In April 2010  Sebastian Stan  who had been mentioned in media accounts as a possibility for the title role of Captain America  was cast as Bucky Barnes  Stan is contracted for multiple films  16  Also in April  it was announced that Hayley Atwell had been cast as Peggy Carter  and that the film s name had been changed from The First Avenger  Captain America to Captain America  The First Avenger  61  The next day it was reported that Joss Whedon would be rewriting the script for Joe Johnston s Captain America  The First Avenger as part of his negotiation to write and direct The Avengers  However  the extent of Whedon s polish on Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely s script remained unknown  62  Whedon later clarified in an August interview that  I just got to make some character connections  The structure of the thing was really tight and I loved it  but there were a couple of opportunities to find his voice a little bit   and some of the other characters   and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be  And progressing through the script to flesh it out a little bit   63  Samuel L  Jackson revealed in an interview that he would reprise his role as Nick Fury in the film  33  Kevin Feige later confirmed that Fury s elite special unit of US Army Rangers  the Howling Commandos  would appear  64  Screenwriter Markus later explained that the unnamed group of commandos that Rogers leads was  called the Howling Commandos in the script  but no one says that out loud   59  Director Johnston said the group was once to have been called the Invaders  leading fans to speculate that the Marvel superhero team of that name would appear in the film  59  In May 2010  Marvel Studios confirmed that Hugo Weaving would play the Red Skull  65  Toby Jones entered final negotiations to play Arnim Zola  31 Iron Man director Jon Favreau said a younger Howard Stark would appear in the film  played by Dominic Cooper  20  21  Hayley Atwell revealed that Tommy Lee Jones would have a role in the film  66  By June  Neal McDonough was in talks to play Dum Dum Dugan  67  Four days later  he confirmed he was taking the part  68  On the same day  Stanley Tucci joined the cast as Dr  Abraham Erskine  the scientist who created the super soldier serum  26   edit  Filming Photo taken in Manchester on the set of Captain America  The First Avenger  Production began on June 28  2010  69  On the same day  Marvel confirmed that Tommy Lee Jones had been cast to play US Army Colonel Chester Phillips  18  The next day Marvel confirmed that Dominic Cooper would portray the younger version of Howard Stark  the character played by John Slattery in Iron Man 2  70  It was announced that the film would shoot in London  England  in late July and was expected to include scenes featuring key London landmarks  71  War scenes were filmed in September at the former Royal Navy Propellant Factory in the Welsh village of Caerwent  72  73  Filming was scheduled to take place that month in the Northern Quarter of Manchester  England  where parts of the 2004 film Alfie and the 2009 Sherlock Holmes had been shot  74  followed by the Stanley Dock area of Liverpool  both doubling for the period s Lower East Side of Manhattan  New York  75  Further scenes were scheduled to be shot in Liverpool s Albert Dock  76  In July 2010  Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige said that both this film and Thor would be released in 3 D  77  Johnston did a one day test shooting with a 3 D rig  rather than shooting in 2 D and converting  and found it  a nightmare  due to bulky gear  calibration issues and restricted filmmaking options  Nevertheless  he said he believes 3 D is  a new challenge and it s exciting   Feige insisted that the conversion would not compromise the film s image quality  as the decision to release the film in 3 D was made early in development  and that  an unprecedented amount of time  would be devoted to the conversion process  to render all the film s visual effects in true 3 D  77   edit  Post production Chris Evans as pre serum Steve Rogers before  top  and after  bottom  he was visually reduced  In November 2010  Stanley Tucci stated that he had completed filming his scenes and that the rest of the production would wrap in about three weeks  78  In February 2011  it was announced that Alan Silvestri had been chosen to compose the film score  79  In March 2011  CraveOnline reported that Captain America  The First Avenger would be undergoing reshoots in the United Kingdom and in Los Angeles in April 2011  80  81  A scene was also filmed in New York City s Times Square on April 23  2011  82  The film features nearly 1 600 visual effects shots  which were split between thirteen different companies  83  To achieve the appearance of the skinny  pre serum Steve Rogers  director Joe Johnston stated that he used two major techniques  Most of the shots were done by an L A  company called LOLA that specializes in digital  plastic surgery   The technique involved shrinking Chris in all dimensions  We shot each skinny Steve scene at least four times  once like a normal scene with Chris and his fellow actors in the scene  once with Chris alone in front of a green screen so his element could be reduced digitally  again with everyone in the scene but with Chris absent so that the shrunken Steve could be re inserted into the scene  and finally with a body double mimicking Chris s actions in case the second technique were required  When Chris had to interact with other characters in the scene  we had to either lower Chris or raise the other actors on apple boxes or elevated walkways to make skinny Steve shorter in comparison  For close ups  Chris  fellow actors had to look at marks on his chin that represented where his eyes would be after the shrinking process  and Chris had to look at marks on the tops of the actor s head to represent their eyes      The second technique involved grafting Chris s head onto the body double  This technique was used mostly when Chris was sitting or lying down  or when a minimum of physical acting was required     84  Captain America s shield  which serves as both a defensive tool and a weapon  came in four types  metal  fiberglass  rubber  and computer graphics  CG   83  Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that  We had the  hero shield   which was made of aluminum  for our beauty shots  and  close up work  We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum faced with a fiberglass back  for use on a daily basis      And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane  which is sort of a synthetic rubber     and we made an ultrasoft one we put on  Evans   back  so that if there were an accident  it wouldn t hurt him   85  Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans  would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move  We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it  Then we would add in a CG shield   83  Hugo Weaving  who portrayed the Red Skull  wore a latex mask conceived by prosthetic makeup designer David White  The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably  as the mask was bulky and they wanted to make it look like tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure  They thinned out Weaving s cheeks and lower lip  hollowed out his eyes  and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character  83  Closing credits were created by visual effects firm Rok t by means of 3 D and stereoscopic processing that used iconic American propaganda images from World War II  such as James Montgomery Flagg s Uncle Sam recuitment poster and Rosie the Riveter  86   edit  Soundtrack Main article  Captain America  The First Avenger  soundtrack  In June 2011  Buena Vista Records announced

to foreign territories  instead offering international markets a choice between the official title and the alternative The First Avenger  Many international distributors chose to retain the original title  believing the franchise name to be more identifiable than the alternative  and that the latter would risk losing ticket sales  Three countries chose the alternative title  Russia  South Korea  and Ukraine  An  insider  speaking to The New York Times explained that the name change in these countries stemmed from cultural and political concerns  though Marvel and Paramount both declined to state an official reason  92  In July 2011  it was thought that the film would not be released in China because of a policy limiting the number of foreign films screened there each year  92  but it eventually opened there in the second weekend of September  93   edit  Marketing Evans promoting the film at San Diego Comic Con in July 2011 during the Military Salute  At the 2010 San Diego Comic

First Avenger has received generally positive reviews from film critics  It has a 79  approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes  based on 214 reviews with an average rating of 6 9 10  and the consensus   With plenty of pulpy action  a pleasantly retro vibe  and a handful of fine performances  Captain America is solidly old fashioned blockbuster entertainment   112 Metacritic  which assigns a weighted average score  rated the film 66 out of 100 based on 36 reviews from critics  113  Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave Captain America  The First Avenger a positive review  saying   Johnston has delivered a light  clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump in the throat nostalgia  with Nazis   who make the best villains  and with loving references to Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark    114 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times remarked   I enjoyed the movie  I appreciated the 1940s period settings and costumes  which were a break with the usual generic cityscapes  I admired the way that director Joe Johnston propelled the narrative  I got a sense of a broad story  rather than the impression of a series of sensational set pieces  If Marvel is wise  it will take this and Iron Man as its templates   115 A  O  Scott of The New York Times declared it  pretty good fun   116  Conversely  Karina Longworth of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review  calling it   A  hokey  hacky  two hour plus exercise in franchise transition price gouging  complete with utterly unnecessary post converted 3 D   117  Peter Debruge of Variety said   Captain America  The First Avenger plays like a by the numbers prequel for Marvel Studios  forthcoming The Avengers movie   118  Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter had mixed feelings about the film  writing   As the last Marvel prequel that includes two Iron Man and Incredible Hulk movies before next summer s The Avengers  this one feels perhaps a little too simplistic and routine   119   edit  Accolades Year Award Category Winner Nominee Result Ref  2011 Teen Choice Awards Choice Summer  Movie Captain America  The First Avenger Nominated  120  Choice Summer Movie
