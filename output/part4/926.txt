Cultural assimilation Racial integration Social integration   Discrimination portal v t e Antisemitism  also spelled anti semitism or anti Semitism  is suspicion of  hatred toward  or discrimination against Jews for reasons connected to their Jewish heritage  In a 2005 U S  governmental report  antisemitism is defined as  hatred toward Jews individually and as a group that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and or ethnicity   1  A person who holds such views is called an  antisemite   Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways  ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized violent attacks by mobs  or even state police  or military attacks on entire Jewish communities  Extreme instances of persecution include the pogroms which preceded the First Crusade in 1096  the expulsion from England in 1290  the massacres of Spanish Jews in 1391  the persecutions of the Spanish Inquisition  the expulsion from Spain in 1492  the expulsion from Portugal in 1497  various Russian pogroms  the Dreyfus Affair  and the Final Solution by Hitler s Germany and official Soviet anti Jewish policies  While the term s etymology might suggest that antisemitism is directed against all Semitic peoples  the term was coined in the late 19th century in Germany as a more scientific sounding term for Judenhass   Jew hatred    2  and that has been its normal use since then  3  Contents 1 Etymology and usage 1 1 Usage 1 2 Etymology 1 3 Definition 1 4 Evolution of usage 2 Forms 2 1 Cultural antisemitism 2 2 Religious antisemitism 2 3

directly opposed to each other  Antisemitism refers specifically to prejudice against Jews alone and in general  3  4  despite the fact that there are other speakers of Semitic languages  e g  Arabs  Ethiopians  or Assyrians  and that not all Jews speak a Semitic language  The term anti Semitic has been used on occasion to include bigotry against other Semitic language peoples such as Arabs  but such usage is not widely accepted  5  6  Both terms anti Semitism and antisemitism are in common use  Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form antisemitism to avoid possible confusion involving whether the term refers specifically to Jews  or to Semitic language speakers as a whole  7  8  9  10  For example  Emil Fackenheim supported the unhyphenated spelling  in order to  dispel   the notion that there is an entity  Semitism  which  anti Semitism  opposes   11   edit  Etymology Cover page of Marr s The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism  1880 edition Although Wilhelm Marr is generally credited with coining the word anti Semitism  see below   Alex Bein writes that the word was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider in the phrase  anti Semitic prejudices   12  Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize Ernest Renan s ideas about how  Semitic races  were inferior to  Aryan races   These pseudo scientific theories concerning race  civilization  and  progress  had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century  especially as Prussian nationalistic historian Heinrich von Treitschke did much to promote this form of racism  He coined the term  the Jews are our misfortune  which would later be widely used by Nazis  13  In Treitschke s writings Semitic was synonymous with Jewish  in contrast to its use by Renan and others  In 1873 German journalist Wilhelm Marr published a pamphlet  The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit  Observed from a non religious perspective     Der Sieg des Judenthums  ber das Germanenthum  Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet    14  in which he used the word  Semitismus  interchangeably with the word  Judentum  to denote both  Jewry   the Jews as a collective  and  jewishness   the quality of being Jewish  or the Jewish spirit   Although he did not use the word  Antisemitismus  in the pamphlet  the coining of the latter word followed naturally from the word  Semitismus   and indicated either opposition to the Jews as a people  or else opposition to Jewishness or the Jewish spirit  which he saw as infiltrating German culture  In his next pamphlet   The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit   published in 1880  Marr developed his ideas further and coined the related German word Antisemitismus   antisemitism  derived from the word  Semitismus  that he had earlier used  The pamphlet became very popular  and in the same year he founded the  League of Antisemites    Antisemiten Liga    the first German organization committed specifically to combatting the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence  and advocating their forced removal from the country  So far as can be ascertained  the word was first widely printed in 1881  when Marr published  Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte   and Wilhelm Scherer used the term  Antisemiten  in the January issue of  Neue Freie Presse   The related word semitism was coined around 1885   edit  Definition Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews  a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions  Holocaust scholar and City University of New York professor Helen Fein defines it as  a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes  and in culture as myth  ideology  folklore and imagery  and in actions   social or legal discrimination  political mobilization against the Jews  and collective or state violence   which results in and or is designed to distance  displace  or destroy Jews as Jews   Elaborating on Fein s definition  Dietz Bering of the University of Cologne writes that  to antisemites   Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature  that is  their bad traits are incorrigible  Because of this bad nature   1  Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective   2  Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies   3  Jews bring disaster on their  host societies  or on the whole world  they are doing it secretly  therefore the antisemites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial  bad Jewish character   15  Antisemitic caricature by C L andre  France  1898  Bernard Lewis defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice  hatred  or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest  According to Lewis  antisemitism is marked by two distinct features  Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others  and they are accused of  cosmic evil   Thus   it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti Semitic  unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism  16  There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally  The U S  Department of State defines antisemitism in its 2005 Report on Global Anti Semitism as  hatred toward Jews individually and as a group that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and or ethnicity   1  In 2005  the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia  now Fundamental Rights Agency   then an agency of the European Union  developed a more detailed working definition  which states   Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews  which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews  Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non Jewish individuals and or their property  toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities   It adds  such manifestations could also target the state of Israel  conceived as a Jewish collectivity   It provides contemporary examples of antisemitism  which include  promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion  promoting negative stereotypes of Jews  holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group  denying the Holocaust or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it  and accusing Jews of dual loyalty or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country  It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic  e g  by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor  or applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation  or holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel  17  1889 Paris  France

edit  Evolution of usage In 1879  Wilhelm Marr founded the Antisemiten Liga  Antisemitic League   Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe in the latter 19th century  For example  Karl Lueger  the popular mayor of fin de si cle Vienna  skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage  18  In its 1910 obituary of Lueger  The New York Times notes that Lueger was  Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria  19  In 1895 A  C  Cuza organized the Alliance Anti semitique Universelle in Bucharest  In the period before World War II  when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace  it was not uncommon for a person  organization  or political party to self identify as an antisemite or antisemitic  In 1882  the early Zionist pioneer Judah Leib Pinsker wrote that antisemitism was an inherited predisposition  Judeophobia is a psychic aberration  As a psychic aberration it is hereditary  and as a disease transmitted for two thousand years it is incurable        In this way have Judaism and Anti Semitism passed for centuries through history as inseparable companions          Having analyzed Judeophobia as an hereditary form of demonopathy  peculiar to the human race  and having represented Anti Semitism as proceeding from an inherited aberration of the human mind  we must draw the important conclusion that we must give  up contending against these hostile impulses as we must against every other inherited predisposition  20  In the aftermath of Kristallnacht  Goebbels announced   The German people is anti Semitic  It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race   21  After Hitler s fall from power  and particularly after the extent of the Nazi genocide of Jews became known  the term  antisemitism  acquired pejorative connotations  This marked a full circle shift in usage  from an era just decades earlier when  Jew  was used as a pejorative term  22  23  Yehuda Bauer wrote in 1984   There are no antisemites in the world    Nobody says   I am antisemitic    You cannot  after Hitler  The word has gone out of fashion   24   edit  Forms Jews  identified by the mandatory Jewish badge and Jewish hat  being burned during the Black Death in 1348  It is often emphasized that there are different forms of antisemitism  Ren  K nig mentions social antisemitism  economic antisemitism  religious antisemitism  and political antisemitism as examples  K nig points out that these different forms demonstrate that the  origins of antisemitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods   K nig asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create  serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of antisemitism   25  These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism  The forms identified are substantially the same  it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ  Bernard Lazare identifies three forms of antisemitism  Christian antisemitism  economic antisemitism  and ethnologic antisemitism  26  William Brustein names four categories  religious  racial  economic and political  27  The Roman Catholic historian Edward Flannery distinguished four varieties of antisemitism  28  page needed  political and economic antisemitism  giving as examples Cicero and Charles Lindbergh  theological or religious antisemitism  sometimes known as anti Judaism  nationalistic antisemitism  citing Voltaire and other Enlightenment thinkers  who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics  such as greed and arrogance  and for observing customs such as kashrut and Shabbat  and racial antisemitism  with its extreme form resulting in the Holocaust by the Nazis  Louis Harap separates  economic antisemitism  and merges  political  and  nationalistic  antisemitism into  ideological antisemitism   Harap also adds a category of  social antisemitism   29  religious  Jew as Christ killer   economic  Jew as banker  usurer  money obsessed   social  Jew as social inferior   pushy   vulgar  therefore excluded from personal contact   racist  Jews as an inferior  race    ideological  Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary   cultural  Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization    edit  Cultural antisemitism Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as  that species of anti Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform  crude   Jewish  culture  30  Similarly  Eric Kandel characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of  Jewishness  as a  religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning  through distinctive traditions and education   According to Kandel  this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing  unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation   31  Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning  the Jews  aloofness from the societies in which they live   32  An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or religious conversion  33   edit  Religious antisemitism See also  Anti Judaism  Christianity and antisemitism  and Islam and antisemitism Religious antisemitism is also known as anti Judaism  Under this version of antisemitism  attacks would often stop if Jews stopped practicing or changed their public faith  especially by conversion to the official or right religion  and sometimes  liturgical exclusion of Jewish converts  the case of Christianized Marranos or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century convicted of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs   34  Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo Christian conflict  religious antisemitism  other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times  Frederick Schweitzer asserts that   most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism  cultural antisemitism  racism or racial antisemitism  economic antisemitism and the like   35  William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds   The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion       a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism   From the perspective of racial antisemitism  however       the assimilated Jew was still a Jew  even after baptism       From the Enlightenment onward  it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews    Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance  without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews  the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable  even before explicitly racist doctrines appear    edit  Economic antisemitism The underlying premise of economic antisemitism is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews  36  Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting antisemitic canards  37 Antisemites say that Jews control the world finances  a theory promoted in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion  and later repeated by Henry Ford and his Dearborn Independent  In the modern era  such myths continue to be spread in books such as The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews published by the Nation of Islam  and on the internet  A caricature from the German antisemitic Der St rmer  around Christmas 1929  It urged Germans to avoid buying from Jewish shops  Derek Penslar writes that there are two components to the financial canards  38  a  Jews are savages that  are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor  b  Jews are  leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination  Abraham Foxman describes six facets of the financial canards  All Jews are wealthy  39  Jews are stingy and greedy 40  Powerful Jews control the business world 41  Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism 42  It is okay for Jews to cheat non Jews 43  Jews use their power to benefit  their own kind  44  Gerald Krefetz summarizes the myth as   Jews  control the banks  the money supply  the economy  and businesses   of the community  of the country  of the world   45  Krefetz gives  as illustrations  many slurs and proverbs  in several different languages  which suggest that Jews are stingy  or greedy  or miserly  or aggressive bargainers  46  During the nineteenth century  Jews were described as  scurrilous  stupid  and tight fisted   but after the Jewish Emancipation and the rise of Jews to the middle  or upper class in Europe were portrayed as  clever  devious  and manipulative financiers out to dominate  world finances    47  Leon Poliakov asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism  but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism  because  without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism  there would be no economic antisemitism   In opposition to this view  Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era  the economic antisemitism is  distinct and nearly constant  but theological antisemitism is  often subdued   48   edit  Racial antisemitism Soviet prisoner of war  August 1941  At least 50 000 Jewish soldiers were shot after selection  Racial antisemitism is prejudice against Jews as a racial ethnic group  rather than Judaism as a religion  49  Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations  In the late 19th century and early 20th century  it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the eugenics movement  which categorized non  Europeans  as inferior  It more specifically claimed that the  Nordic  Europeans were superior  Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their  alien  extra European origins and culture  They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion  Anthropologists discussed whether the Jews possessed any Arabic Armenoid  African Nubian or Asian Turkic ancestries  Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group  In the context of the Industrial Revolution  following the emancipation of the Jews  Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility  With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism  a combination of growing nationalism  the rise of eugenics  and resentment at the socio economic success of the Jews led to the newer  and more virulent  racist antisemitism  According to William Nichols  religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds   The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion       a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism   However  with racial antisemitism   Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew  even after baptism       From the Enlightenment onward  it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews    Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance  without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews  the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable  even before explicitly racist doctrines appear   50  In the early 19th century  a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries  51  52  The old laws restricting them to ghettos  as well as the many laws that limited their property rights  rights of worship and occupation  were rescinded  Despite this  traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by racial antisemitism  encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau and particularly his Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race of 1853 5 Nationalist agendas based on ethnicity  known as ethnonationalism  usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race  53  Allied to this were theories of Social Darwinism  which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings  Such theories  usually posited by white Europeans  advocated the superiority of white Aryans to Semitic Jews  54   edit  Political antisemitism This section requires expansion  William Brustein defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and or world power   Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to  lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises  while seeking to  exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms   55  According to Viktor Kar dy  political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation   56   edit  Apocalyptic antisemitism This section requires expansion  Adolf Hitler s millennial and messianic vision which culminated in the Holocaust is sometimes referred to as an  apocalyptic antisemitism   57  58   edit  Conspiracy theories Holocaust denial and Jewish conspiracy theories are also considered a form of antisemitism  59  60  61  62  63  63  64  65 Zoological conspiracy theories have been propagated by the Arab media and Arabic language websites  alleging a  Zionist plot  behind the use of animals to attack civilians or to conduct espionage   edit  New antisemitism Main article  New antisemitism Starting in the 1990s  some scholars have advanced the concept of New antisemitism  coming simultaneously from the left  the right  and radical Islam  which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the State of Israel  66  and argue that the language of anti Zionism and criticism of Israel are used to attack the Jews more broadly  In this view  the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of Israel and Zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind  and attribute this to antisemitism  67  It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs  including older motifs such as the  Blood Libel   66  Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism  and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and deflect attention from legitimate criticism of the State of Israel  and  by associating anti Zionism with antisemitism  misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies  68   edit  History Main article  History of antisemitism Many authors see the roots of economic antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity  Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism  Pre Christian anti Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature Christian anti semitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was   at least in its classical form   nuanced in that Jews were a protected class Political  social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the New Antisemitism Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories   ancient antisemitism  which was primarily ethnic in nature  Christian antisemitism  which was religious  and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries   69   edit  Ancient world The first clear examples of anti Jewish sentiment can be traced back to Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE  34  Alexandria was home to the largest Jewish community in the world and the Septuagint  a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible  was produced there  Manetho  an Egyptian priest and historian of that time  wrote scathingly of the Jews and his themes are repeated in the works of Chaeremon  Lysimachus  Poseidonius  Apollonius Molon  and in Apion and Tacitus  34 Agatharchides of Cnidus ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the  absurdity of their Law   making a mocking reference to how Ptolemy Lagus was able to invade Jerusalem in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the Shabbat  34  One of the earliest anti Jewish edicts  promulgated by Antiochus Epiphanes in about 170 167 BCE  sparked a revolt of the Maccabees in Judea  In view of Manetho s anti Jewish writings  antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by  the Greek retelling of Ancient Egyptian prejudices   70  The ancient Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died  71  72  The violence in Alexandria may have been caused by the Jews being portrayed as misanthropes  73  Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities  the poleis  74  Bohak has argued  however  that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone  and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians  75  Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many pagan Greek and Roman writers  76  Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews  refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out  Hecataetus of Abdera  a Greek historian of the early third century BCE  wrote that Moses  in remembrance of the exile of his people  instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life   Manetho  an Egyptian historian  wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian lepers who had been taught by Moses  not to adore the gods   The same themes appeared in the works of Chaeremon  Lysimachus  Poseidonius  Apollonius Molon  and in Apion and Tacitus  Agatharchides of Cnidus wrote about the  ridiculous practices  of the Jews and of the  absurdity of their Law  and how Ptolemy Lagus was able to invade Jerusalem in 320 BC because its inhabitants were observing the Sabbath  34  Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially  cultural  taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings   77  There are examples of Hellenistic rulers desecrating the Temple and banning Jewish religious practices  such as circumcision  Shabbat observance  study of Jewish religious books  etc  Examples may also be found in anti Jewish riots in Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE  Philo of Alexandria described an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died  The Jewish diaspora on the Nile island Elephantine  which was founded by mercenaries  experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE  78  Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying Roman Empire were at times antagonistic and resulted in several rebellions  According to Suetonius  the emperor Tiberius expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there  The 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon identified a more tolerant period in Roman Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE citation needed   However  when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire  the state s attitude towards the Jews gradually worsened  James Carroll asserted   Jews accounted for 10  of the total population of the Roman Empire  By that ratio  if other factors such as pogroms and conversions had not intervened  there would be 200 million Jews in the world today  instead of something like 13 million   79  80

Israel Left Right   Category Portal WikiProject v t e From the 9th century CE  the medieval Islamic world classified Jews  and Christians  as dhimmi  and allowed them to practice their religion more freely than they could do in medieval Christian Europe  Under Islamic rule  there was a Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain that lasted until at least the 11th century  81  when several Muslim pogroms against Jews took place in the Iberian Peninsula  those that occurred in C rdoba in 1011 and in Granada in 1066  82  83  84  Several decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were also enacted in Egypt  Syria  Iraq and Yemen from the 11th century  Jews were also forced to convert to Islam or face death in some parts of Yemen  Morocco and Baghdad several times between the 12th and 18th centuries  85  The Almohads  who had taken control of the Almoravids  Maghribi and Andalusian territories by 1147  86  were far more fundamentalist in outlook  and they treated the dhimmis harshly  Faced with the choice of either death or conversion  many Jews and Christians emigrated  87  88  89  Some  such as the family of Maimonides  fled east to more tolerant Muslim lands  87  while some others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms  90  During the Middle Ages in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places  with blood libels  expulsions  forced conversions and massacres  A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious  The persecution hit its first peak during the Crusades  In the First Crusade  1096  flourishing communities on the Rhine and the Danube were destroyed  In the Second Crusade  1147  the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres  The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds  Crusades of 1251 and 1320  The Crusades were followed by expulsions  including  in 1290  the banishing of all English Jews  in 1396  the expulsion of 100 000 Jews in France  and in 1421  the expulsion of thousands from Austria  Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland  91  In medieval and Renaissance Europe  a major contributor to the deepening of antisemitic sentiment and legal action among the Christian populations was the popular preaching of the zealous reform religious orders  the Franciscans  especially Bernardino of Feltre  and Dominicans  especially Vincent Ferrer   who combed European promoting antisemitism through their often fiery  emotional appeals  92  As the Black Death epidemics devastated Europe in the mid 14th century  annihilating more than half of the population

  and Jewish losses were counted in hundreds of thousands  First  the Chmielnicki Uprising when Bohdan Khmelnytsky s Cossacks massacred tens of thousands of Jews in the eastern and southern areas he controlled  today s Ukraine   The precise number of dead may never be known  but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100 000 to 200 000  which also includes

Peter Stuyvesant  the Dutch governor of New Amsterdam  implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city  During the Colonial Era  the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews  It was not until the Revolutionary War did Jews gain legal rights  including the right to vote  However  even at their peak  the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe  96   edit  Enlightenment In 1744  Frederick II of Prussia limited the number of Jews allowed to live in Breslau to only ten so called  protected  Jewish families

abstain from marriage or leave Berlin   quoting Simon Dubnow   In the same year  Archduchess of Austria Maria Theresa ordered Jews out of Bohemia but soon reversed her position  on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years  This extortion was known as malke geld  queen s money   In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son  In 1782  Joseph II abolished most of these persecution practices in his Toleranzpatent  on the condition that Yiddish and Hebrew were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled  Moses Mendelssohn wrote that  Such a tolerance    is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution   In 1772  the empress of Russia Catherine II forced the Jews of the Pale of Settlement to stay in their shtetls and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the partition of Poland  97   edit  Islamic antisemitism in the nineteenth century Historian Martin Gilbert writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries  Benny Morris writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone throwing at Jews by Muslim children  Morris quotes a 19th century traveler   I have seen a little fellow of six years old  with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four  teaching  them  to throw stones at a Jew  and one little urchin would  with the greatest coolness  waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish gaberdine  To all this the Jew is obliged to submit  it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan   98   edit  Secular or racial antisemitism In 1850 the German composer Richard Wagner published Das Judenthum in der Musik   Jewishness in Music   under a pseudonym in the Neue Zeitschrift f r Musik  The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers  particularly Wagner s contemporaries  and rivals  Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer  but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in German culture  Antisemitism can also be found in many of the Grimms  Fairy Tales by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm  published from 1812 to 1857  It is mainly characterized by Jews being the villain of a story  such as in  The Good Bargain  Der gute Handel   and  The Jew Among Thorns  Der Jude im Dorn    The Dreyfus Affair was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century  Alfred Dreyfus  a Jewish artillery captain in the French army  was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans  As a result of these charges  Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment at Devil s Island  The actual spy  Marie Charles Esterhazy  was acquitted  The event caused great uproar among the French  with the public choosing sides regarding whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not   mile Zola accused the army of polluting the French justice system  However  general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty  eighty percent of the press in France condemned him  This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period  99  Adolf Stoecker  1835 1909   the Lutheran court chaplain to Kaiser Wilhelm I  founded in 1878 an antisemitic  antiliberal political party called The Christian Social Party  Germany   However  this party did not attract as many votes as the Nazi party  which flourished in part because of The Great Depression  which hit Germany especially hard during the early 1930s  100  Some scholars view Karl Marx s essay On The Jewish Question as antisemitic  and he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings  101  102  103  Marx s equation of Judaism with capitalism  together with his pronouncements on Jews  strongly influenced socialist movements and shaped their attitudes and policies toward the Jews  Marx s On the Jewish Question influenced National Socialist  as well as Soviet and Arab antisemites  104  105  106 Albert Lindemann and Hyam Maccoby have suggested that Marx was embarrassed by his Jewish background  107  108  Others argue that Marx consistently supported Prussian Jewish communities  struggles to achieve equal political rights  These scholars argue that  On the Jewish Question  is a critique of Bruno Bauer s arguments that Jews must convert to Christianity before being emancipated  and is more generally a critique of liberal rights discourses and capitalism  109  110  111  112  David McLellan and Francis Wheen argue readers should interpret On the Jewish Question in the deeper context of Marx s debates with Bruno Bauer  author of The Jewish Question  about Jewish emancipation in Germany  According to McLellan  Marx used the word Judentum colloquially  as meaning commerce  arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the capitalist mode of production not Judaism or Jews in particular  113   edit  Twentieth century The victims of a 1905 pogrom in Yekaterinoslav Between 1900 and 1924  approximately 1 75 million Jews migrated to America  the bulk from Eastern Europe  Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1 percent of America s total population  but by 1930 Jews formed about 3  percent  This increase  combined with the upward social mobility of some Jews  contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism  In the first half of the 20th century  in the USA  Jews were discriminated against in employment  access to residential and resort areas  membership in clubs and organizations  and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities  The lynching of Leo Frank by a mob of prominent citizens in Marietta  Georgia in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States

interwar period  The pioneer automobile manufacturer Henry Ford propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper The Dearborn Independent  published by Ford from 1919 to 1927   The radio speeches of Father Coughlin in the late 1930s attacked Franklin D  Roosevelt s New Deal and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy  Some prominent politicians shared such views  Louis T  McFadden  Chairman of the United States House Committee on Banking and Currency  blamed Jews for Roosevelt s decision to abandon the gold standard  and claimed that  in the United States today  the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money   116  Einsatzgruppe A members shoot Jews on the outskirts of Kaunas  1941 1942 In the 1940s the aviator Charles Lindbergh and many

intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized   The German American Bund held parades in New York City during the late 1930s  where members wore Nazi uniforms and raised flags featuring swastikas alongside American flags  With the start of U S  involvement in World War II most of the Bund s members were placed by whom   in internment camps  and some were deported by whom

Holocaust  120  Eleven million Jews were targeted for extermination by the Nazis  and some six million were eventually killed  120  121  122  Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for personal conflicts in Soviet Russia  starting from conflict between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky and continuing through numerous conspiracy theories spread by official propaganda  Antisemitism in the USSR reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the  rootless cosmopolitan   euphemism for  Jew   in which numerous Yiddish language poets  writers  painters and sculptors were killed or arrested  123  124  This culminated in the so called Doctors  Plot  1952 1953   Similar antisemitic propaganda in Poland resulted in the flight of Polish Jewish survivors from the country  124  After the war  the Kielce pogrom and  March 1968 events  in communist Poland represented further incidents of antisemitism in Europe  The anti Jewish violence in postwar Poland has a common theme of blood libel rumours  125  126  In 1965 Pope Paul VI disbanded the cult of Simon of Trent  and the shrine erected to him was dismantled by whom    He was removed from the Roman Catholic calendar of

in the United States See also  History of antisemitism in the United States A 2007 survey by the Anti Defamation League  ADL  concluded that 15  of Americans hold antisemitic views  which was in line with the average of the previous ten years  but a decline from the 29  of the early sixties  The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor   with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views   The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common anti Semitic view by the ADL  Other views indicating antisemitism  according to the survey  include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America  and that they are responsible for the death of Christ  The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally  e g  regarding immigration and free speech  The 2007 survey also found that 29  of foreign born Hispanics and 32  of African Americans hold strong anti Semitic beliefs  three times more than the 10  for whites  129  In November 2005  the U S  Commission on Civil Rights examined antisemitism on college campuses  It reported that  incidents of threatened bodily injury  physical intimidation or property damage are now rare   but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a  serious problem   The Commission recommended that the U S  Department of Education s Office for Civil Rights protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and further recommended that Congress clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students  130  On September 19  2006  Yale University founded the Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti Semitism  YIISA   the first North American university based center for study of the subject  as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies  Director Charles Small of the Center cited the increase in antisemitism worldwide in recent years as generating a  need to understand the current manifestation of this disease   131  In June 2011  Yale voted to close this initiative  After carrying out a routine review  the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards  Donald Green  who heads Yale s Institution for Social and Policy Studies  the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run  said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students  As with other programs that had been in a similar situation  the initiative had therefore been cancelled  132  133  This decision has been criticized by figures such as former U S  Commission on Civil Rights Staff Director Kenneth L  Marcus  who is now the director of the Initiative to Combat Anti Semitism and Anti Israelism in America s Educational Systems at the Institute for Jewish and Community Research  and Deborah Lipstadt  who described the decision as  weird  and  strange   134 Antony Lerman has supported Yale s decision  describing the YIISA as a politicized initiative that was devoted to the promotion of Israel rather than to serious research on antisemitism  135  A 2009 study published in Boston Review found that nearly 25 percent of non Jewish Americans blamed Jews for the financial crisis of 2008 2009  with a higher percentage among

highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe  139  The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000  140  Much of the new European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spill over from the long running Arab Israeli conflict since the majority of the perpetrators are from the large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities  However  compared to France  the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe  in Germany Arab and pro Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents  139  141  According to The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism  most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups  and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside  142  On January 1  2006  Britain s chief rabbi  Lord Jonathan Sacks  warned that what he called a  tsunami of antisemitism  was spreading globally  In an interview with BBC Radio 4  Sacks said   A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets  We ve had synagogues desecrated  We ve had Jewish schools burnt to the ground   not here but in France  People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel  therefore they should be banned  which is quite extraordinary because     British Jews see themselves as British citizens  So it s

United Kingdom Further information  British Jews In 2005  a group of British Members of Parliament set up an inquiry into antisemitism  which published its findings in 2006  Its report stated that  until recently  the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond  had been  that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society   It found a reversal of this progress since 2000  It aimed to investigate the problem  identify the sources of contemporary antisemitism and make recommendations to improve the situation  It discussed the influence of the Israel Palestine conflict and issues of anti Israel sentiment versus antisemitism at length and noted  most of those who gave evidence were at pains to explain that criticism of Israel is not to be regarded in itself as antisemitic     The Israeli government itself may  at times  have mistakenly perceived criticism of its policies and actions to be motivated by antisemitism   150  In November 2010  the BBC s investigative program Panorama reported that Saudi national textbooks advocating anti Semitism were being used in Islamic religious programs attended by 5 000 British

schools  Teachers at schools with large numbers of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often  praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews   that  Jew hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students  and that  Muslims laugh or command  teachers  to stop when trying to educate about the Holocaust   Additionally   while some students might protest when some express support for terrorism  none object when students express hate of Jews   saying that it says in  the Quran that you shall kill Jews  all true Muslims hate Jews   Most of these students were said to be born and

been used as fuel for the new form of anti Semitism  this has hurt the Palestinians and exposed them to unprecedented and purposely media ignored abuse by Arab governments  including some of those who claim love for the Palestinians  yet in fact only bear hatred to Jews  This has resulted in Palestinian cries for justice  equality  freedom and even basic human rights being ignored while the world getting consumed with delegitimizing Israel from either ignorance or malice   169  In a 2011 survey by the Pew Research Center  all of the Muslim majority Middle Eastern countries polled held strongly
